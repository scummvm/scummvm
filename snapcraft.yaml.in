summary: ScummVM
description: |
    ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical
    point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data
    files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables
    shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which
    they were never designed!
