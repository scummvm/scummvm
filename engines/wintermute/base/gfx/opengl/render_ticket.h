/**
 * A single RenderTicket.
 * A render ticket is a collection of the data and draw specifications made
 * for a single draw-call in the OSystem-backend for WME. The ticket additionally
 * holds the order in which this call was made, so that it can be detected if
 * the same call is done in the following frame. Thus allowing us to potentially
 * skip drawing the same region again, unless anything has changed. Since a surface
 * can have a potentially large amount of draw-calls made to it, at varying rotation,
 * zoom, and crop-levels we also need to hold a copy of the necessary data.
 * (Video-surfaces may even change their data). The promise that is made when a ticket
 * is created is that what the state was of the surface at THAT point, is what will end
 * up on screen at flip() time.
