/**
 * A 2D-renderer implementation for WME.
 * This renderer makes use of a "ticket"-system, where all draw-calls
 * are stored as tickets until flip() is called, and compared against the tickets
 * from last frame, to determine which calls were the same as last round
 * (i.e. in the exact same order, with the exact same arguments), and thus
 * figure out which parts of the screen need to be redrawn.
 *
 * Important concepts to handle here, is the ordered number of any ticket
 * which is called the "drawNum", every frame this starts from scratch, and
 * then the incoming tickets created from the draw-calls are checked to see whether
 * they came before, on, or after the drawNum they had last frame. Everything else
 * being equal, this information is then used to check whether the draw order changed,
 * which will then create a need for redrawing, as we draw with an alpha-channel here.
 *
 * There is also a draw path that draws without tickets, for debugging purposes,
 * as well as to accomodate situations with large enough amounts of draw calls,
 * that there will be too much overhead involved with comparing the generated tickets.
