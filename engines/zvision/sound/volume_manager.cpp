/*
Estimated relative amplitude of a point sound source as it circles the listener's head from front to rear, due to ear pinna shape.
Maximum attenuation -5dB when fully to rear.  Seems to give a reasonably realistic effect when tested on the Nemesis cloister fountain.
Should be applied AFTER volume profile is applied to script files.
Generating function:
  for 0 < theta < 90, amp = 255;
  for 90 < theta < 180, amp = 255*10^(1-(cos(2*(theta-90))/4))
  where theta is the azimuth, in degrees, of the sound source relative to straight ahead of listener
Source: Own work; crude and naive model that is probably not remotely scientifically accurate, but good enough for a 30-year-old game.
