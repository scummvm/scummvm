Bugs:
	Display:
		Spellcasting tabs are displayed inproperly, switching between them is possible tho
		Cursor icons are drawn twice
		DisplayMan::blitBoxFilledWithMaskedBitmap does not produce the same effect as the original

	Logic:
		Items thrown on the right side end up on the left side
		Restarting the game after the party is dead segfaults

Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM

	Double check enums with hex literals
	Double check strcat, strstr usages
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer and other mouse functions

Code stuff todo:
	Complete stub methods(blitShrink)
	Add proper save header, add error handling to it
	Add translations to f433_processCommand140_saveGame 'LOAD'
