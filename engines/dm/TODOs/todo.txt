Bugs:
	Display:
		Broken colour palette for dungeon and cursor
		Gui is messed up by drawn spell area line on startup
		Spellcasting tabs are displayed inproperly, switching between them is possible tho

	Logic:
		End game method is broken
		Items thrown on the right side end up on the left side 


Possible bugs:
	- k1_LeftMouseButton and k2_RightMouseButton have values 1 and 2 respectively, contrary to the original in the original: MASK0x0001_MOUSE_RIGHT_BUTTON, MASK0x0002_MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON
	- possible garbage value return in f140_getObjectWeight
	- After loading, creatures are in the wrong cells of a square

	
Todo:
	Add wiki entry for DM
	
	I forgot to add localization warnings
	Double check enums with hex literals
	Double check strcat, strstr usages
	I forgot to add a bunch of warning for show/hide mouse pointer and other mouse functions

Finish stuff:
	F0444_STARTEND_Endgame
	Make missing code warnings to STUB methods
	Add quit resuest from scummvm
	f380_processCommandQueue
	Missing main loop methods
	Save file f433_processCommand140_saveGame fails silently
	
	F0438_STARTEND_OpenEntranceDoors
	F0442_STARTEND_ProcessCommand202_EntranceDrawCredits
	G0335_ui_SelectedDialogChoice
	Add dialogs
	Add failcheck to saveing and loading
	


Refactoring
	Places implementing mini mainloop and where input doesn't really matter should call discardInput instead of processInput
