Known bugs (not the original ones):
1. Main hint box (location name) is wrongly positioned on x axis
2. FIXED -- When actions menu shown, some garbage is left under cursor
3. Moving cursor close to right edge of screen causes noticeable slowdown
4. Doors open only half of their height
5. In some rooms main hint box text is misplaced
6. FIXED -- Junk under cursor when clicked on psi powers menu (maybe related to 2)
7. FIXED -- Clicking on inventory item does nothing (should open actions menu)
8. FIXED? -- Energy level is not animated
9. FIXED -- Right guard is not properly drawn for a while after quest item bounce (bounce anim goes over the character)
10. CANTREPRO -- Massive glitches on the right side when walking around the room (regression)
11. Animation (esp. portraits) runs pretty slowly (maybe due to unoptimized code?)
12. Closing door animation is played in wrong rooms, with trashed/invalid sprites
13. FIXED -- CopyScreenBlockWithDotEffect (from AspirantLeave) does not fully remove sprite?
14. FIXED -- DeProf puzzle is broken
15. FIXED -- Wrong dialog lines when trade with Aspirant (before inventory opens)
16. FIXED -- Zorq trader (at TMO) offers trade w/o skull at first try?
17. Wait4/Wait command does not wait as intended?
18. In Who Will Be Saved, Engraving opens incorrectly (maybe related to 4)
19. Some junk is draw in The Wall
20. Can't leave left Victory of The Faith room?
21. Zorq trader at TMO is broken again. Now refuses to trade even when have a skull.

Rooms done so far:
DeProf - solvable (with a rope or psi)
TheWall - missing open doors animation
TheTwins - solvable
TheNoose - solvable (trapdoor is glitchy, see bug 4)

General TODOs:
1. Change script vars access to proxy calls (GetByteVar(12) , SetWordVar(4, 1234))
2. Replace CGA_SCREENBUFFER instances with frontbuffer (or screenbuffer?)
3. Remove redundant target = frontbuffer argument in calls
4. Move all remaining CGA low-level code to cga.c
5. Replace CGA next/prev line calculations with a macro/func
6. Add sound playback


Original game bugs:
1. Actions menu for rope in DeProf shows two "Inspect" choices with different actions
2. SCR_2D_Wait ignores specified delay, always waits for 4 secs
3. Trade with Skull Trader while having only a skull will cause lost of the skull?
4. In Who Will Be Saved raised hand's part is not drawn after reentering the room?
