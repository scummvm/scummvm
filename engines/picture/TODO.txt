NOTES
-------

- The game is completable with revision 20 with some minor glitches (see BUGS).


TODO
------

- Rewrite the resource system to something similar as used by M4
  - each resource type gets its own class, the resource cache manages the resource instances
  - generic resource class which has a method that creates a MemoryReadStream
  - rewrite parts of the engine to use the new resource system
- Add music support (game seems to use XMIDI, MIDI and headerless music...figure out more)
- Add game menu
  - Rewrite from scratch with only minor stuff from the disasm since the original menu is one huge
	messy function
- Extend savegame format (savegame version, description, more data)
- When saving a game, save the whole screen when an animation is playing

BUGS
------

- Crashes sometimes on scene changes
  (I guess because some talktext is still running although the slot used by it has changed)
- Crashes sometimes (e.g. when inside the barn and going up the ladder)

DONE
------
- Implement dirty rectangles (low priority)
- Optimize segment mask redrawing (only redraw what's neccessary)
- Add movie playback functionality (movie format is known, needs implementing)
- Add sound support (after rewrite of the resource system)
- Still some clipping issues (walking upstairs in the saloon, when on top of the tower in the hideout)
