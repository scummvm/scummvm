 * A single entry in the Crusader combat.dat flex.  The files consist of 3 parts:
 * 1. human-readable name (zero-padded 16 bytes)
 * 2. offset table (10x2-byte offsets, in practice only the first 2 offsets are ever used)
 * 3. tactic blocks starting at the offsets given in the offset (in practice only 2 blocks are used)
 *
 * The tactic blocks are a sequence of opcodes of things the NPC should
 * do - eg, turn towards direction X.
