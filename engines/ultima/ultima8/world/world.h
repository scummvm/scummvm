#ifndef ULTIMA8_WORLD_WORLD_H
#define ULTIMA8_WORLD_WORLD_H

// the main world class.

// Current ideas on how to store the game world: (-wjp)

// World contains Map objects. All Map objects are initialized when
//  starting/loading a game.

// Each Map permanently contains the nonfixed objects in that map,
//  ( These objects don't have to be assigned object IDs here, I think )

// When a Map is loaded, it loads the fixed objects from disk.
// All objects in the active map will also have to be assigned object IDs.
//  NB: This has to happen in such a way that when a game is loaded the IDs can
//  be reproduced exactly. (Since running usecode scripts can contain objIDs)
// The first N objIDs will probably be reserved from NPCs (and inventories?)
// After that, for example, the fixed objects could be loaded (in disk-order),
// followed by assigning IDs to the (already loaded) dynamic items.
//  (in basic depth-first order, I would guess)

// NPCs will also have to be stored somewhere. We could keep them in Map #0
// like the original.
// Q: Is the avatar's inventory stored in npcdata?
// Q: Is the number of objIDs reserved for npcdata fixed?

// World also has to have the necessary save/load functions. (Which will
//  mostly consist of calls to the save/load functions of the Map objects.)

// Fixed objects could be kept cached in for better performance, or
// swapped out for memory.

// A clear/reset function would also be useful. (All singletons that store
//  game data need this, actually.)
