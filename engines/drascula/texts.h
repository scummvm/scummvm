#define TEXTVB22 "WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW? "
#define TEXTVB23 "I HAVE TO ADMIT IT. YOU REALLY GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO FIGHT AGAINST THE VAMPIRES. "
#define TEXTVB24 "HEY, TAKE YOUR MONEY. I ADMIT IT WHEN I MAKE A MISTAKE... "
#define TEXTVB25 "LEAVE ME ALONE NOW, I WANT TO GET SOME SLEEP. "
#define TEXTVB26 "WHENEVER YOU ARE READY TO FIGHT AGAINST THE VAMPIRES, JUST COME BACK AND I'LL HELP YOU OUT. "
#define TEXTVB27 "OH, THAT'S EASY. JUST USING THE LIGHT OF ONE CRUCIFIX IS ENOUGH TO DESTROY HIM. "
#define TEXTVB28 "YOU HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WITH DRASCULA, HIS FRISISNOTICS POWERS HAVE MADE OF HIM THE MOST POWERFUL VAMPIRE "
#define TEXTVB29 "YOU'D BE LOST IF IT WASN'T FOR THE... "
#define TEXTVB3 "NO, I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS !! "
#define TEXTVB30 "...BREW! "
#define TEXTVB31 "YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT! I MIGHT HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH MY BACK IN THE FUTURE IF I KEEP ON SLEEPING THIS WAY "
#define TEXTVB32 "WELL, OK, I UNDERSTAND HE WAS A BETTER OPPONENT THAN ME, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE DISCOVERY I MADE ABOUT ANTI-VAMPIRE TECHNIQUES WAS WHAT ACTUALLY PROTECTED ME. "
#define TEXTVB33 "I'VE FOUND  THIS IMMUNIZING BREW THAT KEEPS YOU SAFE FROM ANY VAMPIRES' BITE OR AGAINST HIS FRISISNOTICS POWERS."
#define TEXTVB34 "NO, NO, EXCUSE ME. I HAD IT ONCE BUT IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVE A BREW OF THAT TYPE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF A VAMPIRE GOT IT? "
#define TEXTVB35 "HE'D BE IMMUNIZED AGAINST GARLIC, THE CRUCIFIX, THE SUNSHINE LIGHT...I JUST HAD TO GET RID OF WHAT WAS LEFT FROM IT. TO DO IT I USED THIS SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF THROWING IT IN THE  LAVATORY"
#define TEXTVB36 "DON'T WORRY, I REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW TO MAKE THAT BREW. "
#define TEXTVB37 "I NEED GARLIC, BUT I ALREADY HAVE THEM. HOWEVER YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ME SOME WAX, BUBBLE GUM AND CIGARETTE PAPER OR PERHAPS A NAPKING OR SOMETHING ALIKE "
#define TEXTVB38 "OH...AND OF COURSE THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT. LEAVES FROM A VERY STRANGE PLANT CALLED FERNAN. "
#define TEXTVB39 "IT'S A CLIMBING PLANT WHICH LEAVES HAVE MAGIC POWERS IF THEY'RE CUT WITH A GOLDEN SICKLE. "
#define TEXTVB4 "GET OUT!! "
#define TEXTVB40 "SO THAT AS SOON AS YOU HAVE THESE FIVE THINGS, JUST COME HERE AND I'LL MAKE THE BREW. "
#define TEXTVB41 "YOU'LL BE READY THEN TO FIGHT AGAINST DRASCULA "
#define TEXTVB42 "REMEMBER: WAX, NICOTINE, A PIECE OF BUBBLE GUM, A PAPER AND SOME FERNAN'S LEAVES CUT WITH A GOLDEN SICKLE."
#define TEXTVB43 "I TOLD YOU! IT WAS JUST BECAUSE OF THE BREW! "
#define TEXTVB44 "OH, ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO MAKE MYSELF A...THE BREW. JUST A MOMENT, OK? "
#define TEXTVB45 "IT'S A PROTECTING SPELL AGAINST VAMPIRES. "
#define TEXTVB46 "I PUT IT THERE IN ORDER TO PRETEND THAT THE SKETCHER DIDN'T FORGET TO DRAW THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE FROM OUTSIDE. "
#define TEXTVB47 "ALL RIGHT, THE FIRST THING YOU MUST KNOW IS THE WAY TO DRASCULA'S CASTLE. "
#define TEXTVB48 "THERE IS A CAVERN THAT GETS YOU STRAIGHT FROM THE CASTLE. IGOR, THE CRAZY ELVIS' FUN, TAKES IT TO GET TO THE VILLAGE EACH MORNING. "
#define TEXTVB49 "BE CAREFUL THOUGH, THERE IS A VAMPIRE ALWAYS WATCHING OVER IT. YOU'LL HAVE TO GET RID OF HIM. "
#define TEXTVB5 "IT'S TOO LATE NOW, YOU IDIOT!! IT ALWAYS IS  "
#define TEXTVB50 "THERE IS  AN OLD WELL RIGHT BY THE CEMETERY CHURCH "
#define TEXTVB51 "IT WAS USED A LONG TIME AGO FOR WITCHCRAFT TRIALS "
#define TEXTVB52 "THEY THREW THE WITCHES IN THE WELL. IF THEY DROWNED THEY WERE REAL WITCHES. IF THEY DIDN'T, THEY WEREN'T. "
#define TEXTVB53 "WE THREW ONE ONCE AND SHE DIDN'T DROWN, I GUESS SHE WASN'T A WITCH "
#define TEXTVB54 "ANYWAY. THERE IS YOUR BREW. HOWEVER, I ONLY GOT TO MAKE ENOUGH JUST FOR ONE PERSON "
#define TEXTVB55 "YOU'D BETTER SMOKE IT RIGHT BEFORE YOU FIGHT AGAINST DRASCULA "
#define TEXTVB56 "COME ON, RUN! "
#define TEXTVB57 "OH, JUST EXCUSES...! "
#define TEXTVB58 "ARE YOU JOHN HACKER? I'M DOCTOR VON BRAUN "
#define TEXTVB59 "LISTEN TO ME, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S ABOUT THE BREW"
#define TEXTVB6 "I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. "
#define TEXTVB60 "SHUT UP AND LET ME TALK. I JUST FOUND THIS BOOK ABOUT ANTI-VAMPIRE BREWS WARNING AGAINST MIXING THE JOINT WITH ANY ALCOHOLIC DRINK BEFORE YOU"
#define TEXTVB61 "ALCOHOL REACTS WHEN MIXED WITH BREW, SO THAT IT CANCELS OUT ITS EFFECTS JUST IN A FEW SECONDS. "
#define TEXTVB62 "I'M SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO HANG UP RIGHT NOW. THE POLICE IS LOOKING FOR ME, THEY THINK I'M A PUSHER. STUPID, ISN'T IT?. ANYWAY, BYE AND GOOD LUCK SAVING THE WORLD! "
#define TEXTVB7 "ME, SCARED? "
#define TEXTVB8 "LISTEN HERE, DUDE. YOU'RE RIGHT NOW TALKING TO THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS THE SECRET TO FIGHT AGAINST THE VAMPIRE."
#define TEXTVB9 "YOU NEED TO HAVE SPECIAL SKILLS TO FIGHT AGAINST A VAMPIRE. NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO IT "
#define SYS0  "PRESS SUPR AGAIN TO restart"
#define SYS1  "press ESC again to exit"

#define HIS1  "A long time ago, it seems that Drascula killed Von Braun's wife, and then, as he intended to face the count, Von Braun started to investigate all he found vampires."
#define HIS2  "When he thought he was ready, he came up to the castle and had a very violent encounter with Drascula." 
#define HIS3  "Nobody knows exactly what happened there. Although Von Braun lost, Drascula could not kill him."
#define HIS4  "Von Braun felt humiliated by his defect, run away from the castle and has never dared to face Drascula ever again."
