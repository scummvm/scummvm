/**
 * @defgroup TinselCoroutines	Coroutine support for Tinsel
 *
 * The following is loosely based on an article by Simon Tatham:
 *   <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html>.
 * However, many improvements and tweaks have been made, in particular
 * by taking advantage of C++ features not available in C.
 *
 * Why is this code here? Well, the Tinsel engine apparently used
 * setjmp/longjmp based coroutines as a core tool from the start, and
 * so they are deeply ingrained into the whole code base. When we
 * started to get Tinsel ready for ScummVM, we had to deal with that.
 * It soon got clear that we could not simply rewrite the code to work
 * without some form of coroutines. While possible in principle, it
 * would have meant a major restructuring of the entire code base, a
 * rather daunting task. Also, it would have very likely introduced
 * tons of regressons.
 *
 * So instead of getting rid of the coroutines, we chose to implement
 * them in an alternate way, using Simon Tatham's trick as described
 * above. While the trick is dirty, the result seems to be clear enough,
 * we hope; plus, it allowed us to stay relatively close to the
 * original structure of the code, which made it easier to avoid
 * regressions, and will be helpful in the future when comparing things
 * against the original code base.
