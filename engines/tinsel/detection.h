 * The following is the ScummVM definitions of the various Tinsel versions:
 * TINSEL_V0 - This was an early engine version that was only used in the Discworld 1
 *			demo.
 * TINSEL_V1 - This was the engine version used by Discworld 1. Note that there were two
 *			major releases: an earlier version that used *.gra files, and a later one that
 *			used *.scn files, and contained certain script and engine bugfixes. In ScummVM,
 *			we treat both releases as 'Tinsel 1', since the engine fixes from the later
 *			version work equally well the earlier version data.
 * TINSEL_V2 - This is the engine used for the Discworld 2 game.
