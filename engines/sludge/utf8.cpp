/*
 Basic UTF-8 manipulation routines
 by Jeff Bezanson
 placed in the public domain Fall 2005

 This code is designed to provide the utilities you need to manipulate
 UTF-8 as an internal string encoding. These functions do not perform the
 error checking normally needed when handling UTF-8 data, so if you happen
 to be from the Unicode Consortium you will want to flay me alive.
 I do this because error checking can be performed at the boundaries (I/O),
 with these routines reserved for higher performance on data known to be
 valid.
