/*
	We have the following information from Lars Christensen (lechimp) and
	Jamieson Christian (jamieson630):

	RESOURCE DATA
	LE 2 bytes Resource size
	2 bytes Unknown
	2 bytes 'so'
	14 bytes Unknown
	BE 2 bytes Instrument for Stream 1
	BE 2 bytes Instrument for Stream 2
	BE 2 bytes Instrument for Stream 3
	BE 2 bytes Instrument for Stream 4
	BE 2 bytes Instrument for Stream 5
	BE 2 bytes Offset to Stream 1
	BE 2 bytes Offset to Stream 2
	BE 2 bytes Offset to Stream 3
	BE 2 bytes Offset to Stream 4
	BE 2 bytes Offset to Stream 5
	? bytes The streams

	STREAM DATA
	BE 2 bytes Unknown (always 1?)
	2 bytes Unknown (always 0?)
	BE 2 bytes Number of events in stream
	? bytes Stream data

	Each stream event is exactly 3 bytes, therefore one can
	assert that numEvents == (streamSize - 6) / 3. The
	polyphony of a stream appears to be 1; in other words, only
	one note at a time can be playing in each stream. The next
	event is not executed until the current note (or rest) is
	finished playing; therefore, note duration also serves as the
	time delta between events.

	FOR EACH EVENTS
	BE 2 bytes Note duration
	1 byte Note number to play (0 = rest/silent)

	Oh, and quick speculation -- Stream 1 may be used for a
	single-voice interleaved version of the music, where Stream 2-
	5 represent a version of the music in up to 4-voice
	polyphony, one voice per stream. I postulate thus because
	the first stream of the Mac Loom theme music contains
	interleaved voices, whereas the second stream seemed to
	contain only the pizzicato bottom-end harp. Stream 5, in this
	example, is empty, so if my speculation is correct, this
	particular musical number supports 3-voice polyphony at
	most. I must check out Streams 3 and 4 to see what they
	contain.

	==========

	The instruments appear to be identified by their resource IDs:

	1000	Dual Harp
	10895	harp1
	11445	strings1
	11548	silent
	13811	staff1
	15703	brass1
	16324	flute1
	25614	accordian 1
	28110	f horn1
	29042	bassoon1
