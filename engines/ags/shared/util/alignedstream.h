// Class AlignedStream
// A simple wrapper around stream that controls data padding.
//
// Originally, a number of objects in AGS were read and written directly
// as a data struct in a whole. In order to support backwards compatibility
// with games made by older versions of AGS, some of the game objects must
// be read having automatic data alignment in mind.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// AlignedStream uses the underlying stream, it overrides the reading and
// writing, and inserts extra data padding when needed.
//
// Aligned stream works either in read or write mode, it cannot be opened in
// combined mode.
//
// AlignedStream does not support seek, hence moving stream pointer to random
// position will break padding count logic.
//
