 // MemoryStream does reading and writing over the buffer of bytes stored in
 // memory. Currently has rather trivial implementation. Does not own a buffer
 // itself, but works with the provided C-buffer pointer, which means that the
 // buffer object *must* persist until stream is closed.
 //
 // VectorStream is a specialized implementation that works with std::vector.
 // Unlike base MemoryStream provides continiously resizing buffer for writing.
 // TODO: separate StringStream for reading & writing String object?
