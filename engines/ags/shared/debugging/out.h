//
// Debug output interface provides functions which send a formatted message
// tagged with group ID and message type to the registered output handlers.
//
// Depending on configuration this message may be printed by any of those
// handlers, or none of them. The calling unit should not worry about where the
// message goes.
//
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// On using message types.
//
// Please keep in mind, that there are different levels of errors. AGS logging
// system allows to classify debug message by two parameters: debug group and
// message type. Sometimes message type alone is not enough. Debug groups can
// also be used to distinct messages that has less (or higher) importance.
//
// For example, there are engine errors and user (game-dev) mistakes. Script
// commands that cannot be executed under given circumstances are user
// mistakes, and usually are not as severe as internal engine errors. This is
// why it is advised to use a separate debug group for mistakes like that to
// distinct them from reports on the internal engine's problems and make
// verbosity configuration flexible.
//
// kDbgMsg_Debug - is the most mundane type of message (if the printing function
// argument list does not specify message type, it is probably kDbgMsg_Debug).
// You can use it for almost anything, from noting some process steps to
// displaying current object state. If certain messages are meant to be printed
// very often, consider using another distinct debug group so that it may be
// disabled to reduce log verbosity.
//
// kDbgMsg_Info - is a type for important notifications, such as initialization
// and stopping of engine components.
//
// kDbgMsg_Warn - this is suggested for more significant cases, when you find
// out that something is not right, but is not immediately affecting engine
// processing. For example: certain object was constructed in a way that
// would make them behave unexpectedly, or certain common files are missing but
// it is not clear yet whether the game will be accessing them.
// In other words: use kDbgMsg_Warn when there is no problem right away, but
// you are *anticipating* that one may happen under certain circumstances.
//
// kDbgMsg_Error - use this kind of message is for actual serious problems.
// If certain operation assumes both positive and negative results are
// acceptable, it is preferred to report such negative result with simple
// kDbgMsg_Debug message. kDbgMsg_Error is for negative results that are not
// considered acceptable for normal run.
//
// kDbgMsg_Fatal - is the message type to be reported when the program or
// component abortion is imminent.
