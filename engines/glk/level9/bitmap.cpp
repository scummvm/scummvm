/*
	The ST image file has the following format. It consists of a 44 byte header
	followed by the image data.

	The header has the following format:
	Bytes 0-31:     sixteen entry ST palette
	Bytes 32-33:    padding
	Bytes 34-35:    big-endian word holding number of bitplanes needed to make
				up a row of pixels*
	Bytes 36-37:    padding
	Bytes 38-39:    big-endian word holding number of rows in the image*
	Bytes 40-41:    padding**
	Bytes 42-43:    mask for pixels to show in last 16 pixel block. Again, this
				is big endian

	[*]     these are probably big-endian unsigned longs but I have designated
			the upper two bytes as padding because (a) Level 9 does not need
			them as longs and (b) using unsigned shorts reduces byte sex induced
			byte order juggling.
	[**]    not certain what this is for but I suspect that, like bytes 42-43
			it is a mask to indicate which pixels to show, in this case in the
			first 16 pixel block

	The image data is essentially a memory dump of the video RAM representing
	the image in lo-res mode. In lo-res mode each row is 320 pixels wide
	and each pixel can be any one of sixteen colours - needs 4 bits to store.

	In the ST video memory (in lo-res mode which we are dealing with here)
	is organised as follows. The lowest point in memory in the frame buffer
	represents the top-left of the screen, the highest the bottom-right.
	Each row of pixels is stored in sequence.

	Within each pixel row the pixels are stored as follows. Each row is
	divided into groups of 16 pixels. Each sixteen pixel group is stored
	in 8 bytes, logically four groups of two. Each two byte pair
	is a bit-plane for that sixteen pixel group - that is it stores the
	same bit of each pixel in that group. The first two bytes store the
	lowest bit, the second pair the second bit &c.

	The word at bytes 34-35 of the header stores the number of bitplanes
	that make up each pixel row in the image. Multplying this number by
	four gives the number of pixels in the row***. For title and frame
	images that will be 320, for sub-images it will be less.

	[***]   Not always exactly. For GnomeRanger sub-images this value is 60
			- implying there are 240 pixels per row. In fact there are only
			225 pixels in each row. To identify this situation look at the
			big-endian word in bytes 42-43 of the header. This is a mask
			telling you the pixels to use. Each bit represents one pixel in
			the block, with the MSBit representing the first pixel and the
			LSbit the last.

			In this situation, the file does contain the entire sixteen
			pixel block (it has to with the bitplane arrangement) but
			the pixels which are not part of the image are just noise. When
			decoding the image, the L9BITMAP produced has the actual pixel
			dimensions - the surplus pixels are discarded.

			I suspect, though I have not found an instance, that in theory
			the same situation could apply at the start of a pixel row and that
			in this case the big-endian word at bytes 40-41 is the mask.

	Having obtained the pixel dimensions of the image the function uses
	them to allocate memory for the bitmap and then extracts the pixel
	information from the bitmap row by row. For each row eight byte blocks
	are read from the image data and passed to UnpackSTv1Pixels along with
	the number of pixels to extract (usually 16, possibly less for the last
	block in a row.)

		three bits are used IE the value can only be 0-7 not the full
		possible 0-15 and so the MSbit in each nybble is always 0.**,

		element?
	Bytes 42-297: "pixelTable": an array of 0x100 bytes used as a lookup table
		for pixel values
	Bytes 298-313: "bitStripTable": an array of 0x10 bytes used as a lookup table

		decoded
	Bytes 314-569:  "indexByteTable": an array of 0x100 bytes used as a lookup
		table to index into bitStripTable and pixelTable****

	The encoded image data then follows ending in a 0x00 at the file length stored
	in the first two bytes of the file. there is then one extra byte holding a
	checksum produced by the addition of all the bytes in the file (except the first
	two and itself)*

	[*] in some PC games the file is padded out beyond this length to the
	nearest 0x80/0x00 boundary with the byte 0x1A. The valid data in the
	file still finishes where this word says with the checkbyte following it.
	[**] I imagine when a game was running on a PC this standard palette
	was algorithimcally changed to suit the graphics mode being used
	(Hercules, MDA, CGA, EGA, MCGA, VGA &c.)
	[***]   Note also, in image 1 of PC Time & Magik I think one palette entry
	is bad as what should be white in the image is actually set to
	a very pale yellow. This is corrected with the display of the next
	sub-picture and I am pretty sure it is note a decoding problem
	here as when run on the PC the same image has the same pale yellow
	cast.
	[****] for detail of how all this works see below

	As this file format is intended for two very different platforms the decoded
	imaged data is in a neutral, intermediate form. Each pixel is extracted as a
	byte with only the low four bits significant. The pixel value is an index into
	the sixteen entry palette.

	The pixel data is compressed, presumably to allow a greater number of images
	to be distributed on the (rather small) default ST & PC floppy disks (in both
	cases about 370 Kbytes.)*****

	Here's how to decode the data. The image data is actually a contiguous bit
	stream with the byte structure on disk having almost no relevance to the
	encoding. We access the bit stream via a two-byte buffer arranged as a word.

	Preparation:

	Initially, move the first byte from the image data into the low byte of
	theBitStreamBuffer and move the second byte of the image data into the
	high byte of theBitStreamBuffer.

	Set a counter (theBufferBitCounter) to 8 which you will use to keep track
	of when it is necesary to refill the buffer.

	Set a L9BYTE variable (theNewPixel) to byte 40 (seedByte) of the header.
	We need to do this because as part of identifying the pixel being
	extracted we need to know the value of the previous pixel extracted. Since
	none exists at this point we must prime this variable with the correct
	value.

	Extraction:

	Set up a loop which you will execute once for each pixel to be extracted
	and within that loop do as follows.

	Copy the low byte of theBitStreamBuffer to an L9BYTE
	(theNewPixelIndexSelector). Examine theNewPixelIndexSelector. If this
	is 0xFF this flags that the index to the new pixel is present as a
	literal in the bit stream; if it is NOT 0xFF then the new pixel index
	value has to be decoded.

	If theNewPixelIndexSelector is NOT 0xFF do as follows:

	Set the variable theNewPixelIndex to the byte in the
	indexByteTable array of the header indexed by
	theNewPixelIndexSelector.

	Set the variable theBufferBitStripCount to the value in the
	bitStripTable array of the header indexed by theNewPixelIndex.

	One-by-one use right bit shift (>>) to remove
	theBufferBitStripCount bits from theBitStreamBuffer. After each
	shift decrement theBufferBitCounter and check whether it has
	reached 0. If it has, get the next byte from the image data and
	insert it in the high byte of theBitStreamBuffer and reset
	theBufferBitCounter to 8. What is happening here is as we remove
	each bit from the bottom of the bit stream buffer we check to see
	if there are any bits left in the high byte of the buffer. As soon
	as we know there are none, we refill it with the next eight bits
	from the image data.

	When this 'bit-stripping' is finished, other than actually identifying
	the new pixel we are nearly done. I will leave that for the moment and
	look at what happens if the low byte of theBitStreamBuffer we put in
	theNewPixelIndexSelector was actually 0xFF:

	In this case, instead of the above routine we begin by removing
	the low eight bits from the theBitStreamBuffer. We use the same
	ono-by-one bit shift right process described above to do this,
	again checking after each shift if it is necesary to refill the
	buffer's high byte.

	When the eight bits have been removed we set theNewPixelIndex to
	the value of the low four bits of theBitStreamBuffer. Having done
	that we again one-by-one strip off those low four bits from the
	theBitStreamBuffer, again checking if we need to refill the buffer
	high byte.

	Irrespective of whether we initially had 0xFF in
	theNewPixelIndexSelector we now have a new value in theNewPixelIndex.
	This value is used as follows to obtain the new pixel value.

	The variable theNewPixel contains either the seedByte or the value of
	the previously extracted pixel. In either case this is a 4-bit value
	in the lower 4 bits. Use the left bit shift operator (or multiply by
	16) to shift those four bits into the high four bits of theNewPixel.

	Add the value in theNewPixelIndex (it is a 4-bit value) to
	theNewPixel. The resulting value is used as an index into the
	pixelTable array of the header to get the actual new pixel value so
	theNewPixel = header.pixelTable[theNewPixel] gets us our new pixel and
	primes theNewPixel for the same process next time around the loop.

	Having got our new pixel it is stored in the next empty space in the
	bitmap and we loop back and start again.

	[*****] I am not sure how the compression was done - someone with a better
	understanding of this area may be able to work out the method from the above.
	I worked out how to decode it by spending many, many hours tracing through the
	code in a debugger - thanks to the now defunct HiSoft for their DevPac ST and
	Gerin Philippe for NoSTalgia <http://users.skynet.be/sky39147/>.

/*
	The C64 graphics file format is (loosely) based on the layout of
	C64 graphics memory. There are in fact two formats (i) the
	standard game images and (ii) title pictures. For both formats
	the file begins within the 2-byte pair 0x00 and 0x20.

	The images are "multi-color bitmap mode" images which means they
	have rows of 160 double width pixels and can be up to 200 rows
	long. (The title images are 200 lines long, the game images are
	136 lines long.) Unlike Amiga, Mac, ST and PC graphics there are
	no "main" and "sub" images. All game graphics have the same
	dimensions and each completely replaces its predecessor.

	The graphics files used on the Amstrad CPC and Spectrum +3 are also
	virtually identical to C64 graphics files. This choice was presumably
	made because although the CPC screen was more capable than the c64 it
	was (in low resolution) the same size (160*200) and presumably
	algorothmic conversion conversion of the colours was trivial for
	the interpreter. In addition (a) the artwork already existed so no
	extra expense would be incurred and (b) by accepting the C64's
	limitation of only four colours in each 4*8 pixel block (but still
	with sixteen colours on screen) they got a compressed file format
	allowing more pictures on each disk.

	The file organisation is rather different though. Only picture
	one and the title picture are separate files. All the other
	pictures (2-29) are stored in one large file "allpics.pic".

	On these platforms the picture 1 file and title picture file have
	an AMSDOS header (a 128 byte block of metadata) which contains a
	checksum of the first 66 bytes of the header in a little-endian
	word at bytes 67 & 68. On the original C64 platform there was a
	simple two byte header. Following the header the data is organised
	exactly as in the C64 game and title image files. The
	'allpics.pic" file has no header and consists of 0x139E blocks
	each forming a picture, in the C64 game file format (minus the two
	byte header).

/*
	The graphics files used by the BBC B are virtually identical
	to C64 graphics files. I assume that (as with the CPC and
	Spectrum+3) this choice was made because the BBC mode 2 screen,
	was nearly the same size (160*256) and had roughly the same capability
	as the C64 screen (displays 16 colours, although eight of those ar
	just the first eight flashing).

	In addition (a) the artwork already existed so no extra expense would
	be incurred and (b) by accepting the C64's limitation of only four
	colours in each 4*8 pixel block (but still with sixteen colours on
	screen) they got a compressed file format allowing more pictures
	on each disk.

	The file organisation is very close to the C64. The naming system
	can be the same eg "PIC12", but another form is also used :
	"P.Pic12". Unlike the C64 the BBC has well defined title images,
	called "TITLE" or P.Title. All pictures are in separate files.

	The only difference seems to be:

	* There is either *no* header before the image data or a simple
	10 byte header which I think *may* be a file system header
	left in place by the extractor system.

	* There is an extra 32 bytes following the data at the end of
	each file. These bytes encode a table to convert between the 16
	C64 colours and 16, four-pixel pix-patterns used to let the BBC
	(with only 8 colours) represent the sixteen possible C64 colours.

	A pix-pattern looks like this:

			 |   Even |   Odd   |
			 | Column | Column  |
		-----------------------------
		Even Row |Pixel 1 | Pixel 2 |
		---------|--------|---------|
		Odd Row  |Pixel 3 | Pixel 4 |
		-----------------------------

	Each of the four pixel *can* be any of the eight BBC Mode 2
	steady colours. In practice they seem either to be all the
	same or a simple check of two colours - the pixels in the
	odd row being in the reverse order to those in the even row.

	When converting a C64 pixel to a BBC pixel the game uses the
	value of the C64 pixel as an index into the array of sixteen
	BBC pix-patterns. The game looks at the selected pattern and
	chooses the BBC pixel colour thus: if the pixel is in an even
	numbered row and an even numbered column, it uses Pixel 1 from
	the pattern, if in an even row but an odd column, it uses Pixel 3
	and so on.

	The pix-pattern data is encoded thus: the first sixteen bytes
	encode the even row pixels for the patterns, one byte per
	pattern, and in the same way the second sixteen bytes encode
	the odd row pixels for each pattern. For example for the
	pattern representing C64 colour 0 the even row pixels are encoded
	in the first byte and the odd row pixels in the sixteenth byte.

	Within each byte the pixels are encoded in this way:

	Bit     7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
	-------------------------------------
			0   0   1   0   0   1   1   1
			|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
			+---|---+---|---+---|---+---|----- Even Pixel 0101 (5)
				|       |       |       |
				+-------+-------+-------+----- Odd Pixel 0011 (3)

	This function calls the C64 decoding routines to do the actual
	loading. See the comments to that function for details of how the
	image is encoded and stored.
