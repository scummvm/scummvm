 * Base view class for screens and dialogs that appear on-screen.
 * The View class takes care of two important things:
 * 1) By default events get sent to all controls on a view until one
 * handles it. For mouse events, we instead want only the control the
 * mouse cursor is over to receive the events, saving the individual
 * controls from having to check if the mouse is within their bounds.
 * 2) Individual elements will get a Focus/Unfocus message as the
 * mouse enters and leaves them. This allows, for example, buttons
 * that have been pressed to de-select if the mouse leaves their bounds.
