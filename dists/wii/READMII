DISPLAY SETUP

  "Graphics mode"
    you can choose between multiple overscan options to adjust the screen size
    used for drawing. select a higher overscan mode to get rid of black
    borders or choose a lower overscan mode if parts of the picture get cropped

  "Fullscreen mode"
    If your wii is set to 16:9, this will stretch the picture to fullscreen.
    Turning this option off results in black borders on the left and right
    sides, but the aspect ratio will be kept. This option has no effect on 4:3
    displays

  you have to restart scummvm after changing one of these options
