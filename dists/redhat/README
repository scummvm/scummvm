How to build an RPM:


Note: the following assumes that the RPM topdir is /usr/src/redhat .
If you have set a different topdir in /usr/lib/rpm/macros or ~/.rpmmacros,
adapt the below instructions where necessary.


1) Collect sources:

Place residualvm-%{version}.tar.bz2, libmad-0.15.1b.tar.bz2 
and libmpeg2-0.5.1.tar.gz in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES .
If you have a different version of libmad, put the correct version
numbers in the .spec file.

Place residualvm.spec in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS .

2) Build the rpm:

Change directory to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS .
Run:

rpmbuild -ba residualvm.spec

The RPM should now be built and placed in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and
the source RPM in /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS

Note: libmad and libmpeg2 are statically linked into the residualvm binary
because Fedora does not carry a libmad and libmpeg2 package, so I did not
want to make the residualvm package depend on them.
