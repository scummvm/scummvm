1) At first, for building you need (64bit) linux.

2) Install Android SDK and NDK (You can unpack them into ~/android directory), and download required tools.

	https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html
	https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html (you can download GUI Android Studio with SDK (which installs
from studio) or download command-line tools)

Download this:

	Android SDK Tools
	Android SDK Platform-tools
	Android SDL Build tools
	Android 7.1.1 (API 25) or higher
	SDK Platform (API 25) or higher
	Extras/Android Support Repository

3) Install JDK. You can do it from apt-get tool or download from official site (in this case you must set envirnoment 
value to JDK, see guides "How install JDK and set envirnoment values to JDK).

Command:
	sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

4) Set envirnoment values to Android's tools. For set android environment I create and use simple script setenv-android.sh.
In this sript you must set your paths and tools versions. If script don't work (see results from command "printenv") - set
this values manually. Warning: values will be setted for one command-line session.

Script:
	#!/bin/sh

	export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/android-sdk
	export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=~/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle
	export PATH=$ANDROID_NDK_HOME:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH
	export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/25.0.2:$PATH

5) Install packages, which needs for build:

Commands:
	sudo apt-get install ant //If you install manually - set envirnoment value to Ant
	sudo apt-get install make
	sudo apt-get install git-core

6) Create and put keystore (You can use debug version) in ~/.android/debug.keystore

8) Now you can build project
	cd scummvm/dists/androidsdl
	./build.sh

Your apk will be stored in this folder
