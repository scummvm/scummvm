# Specify path to download application data in zip archive in the form 'Description|URL|MirrorURL^Description2|URL2|MirrorURL2^...'
# If you'll start Description with '!' symbol it will be enabled by default, other downloads should be selected by user from startup config menu
# If the URL in in the form ':dir/file.dat:http://URL/' it will be downloaded as binary BLOB to the application dir and not unzipped
# If the URL does not contain 'http://' it is treated as file from 'project/jni/application/src/AndroidData' dir -
# these files are put inside .apk package by build system
# Also please avoid 'https://' URLs, many Android devices do not have trust certificates and will fail to connect to SF.net over HTTPS
