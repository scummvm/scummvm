List of fixed bugs in GF scripts:

+Various bugs
	-Issues with CD check:
	The CD check function doesn't work correctly, so we skip it.

	-Fix the behaviour of dofile statement
	In _system.lua there is a re-definition of dofile, used to load
	scripts from some others positions ("Scripts\" and "d:\\grimFandango\\Scripts\\").
	This cause a lot of warnings when an non-existent file is required.
	Moreover this function is bugged: it always returns nil, even if the
	file has correctly loaded. So it's has been modified to load scripts
	only from the main path and it returns nil when the file has
	successfully loaded, otherwise the number one (which is a boolean
	true). The last modification is required, since the others scripts
	expect this behavior.

	-Fix bug #312 "Manny disappears while holding and examining the sign the Ruba."
	In sg and na sets, if Manny examine the sign of Ruba, it zoom the
	visual near the sign, by changing the setup and putting Manny and the
	sign in it. The code that translate the coordinates of Manny is
	bugged, since it doesn't distinguish the case when the sign is
	planted or not; in particular, it's right when it's planted. This
	patch add a check of state of sign, and set Manny in a fixed position
	(in the centre of the scene) when he is holding the sign. It also
	corrects the behaviour of Manny's head, since he doesn't look at the
	sign, when he is examining it. This is caused by the lacks of
	"enable_head_control(FALSE/TRUE)" before and after
	"START/END_CUT_SCENE()" and by a call at "manny:head_look_at_point"
	with the wrong arguments (a table instead of the coordinates instead
	of single coordinates).

	-Fix bug #397 "Keyboard jams in inventory in beaver dam."
	The function bd.fake_beaver animates a beaver when another one has jumped
	into the dam. This animation is performed into a cutscene block (between
	START/END_CUT_SCENE()), so if the user opens the inventory a bit before
	this function is called, the interface will froze, since in
	cutscenes the keyboard is locked. This patch check if the inventory is open
	(with inInventorySet()) before bd.fake_beaver and MakeSectorActive
	are called (in bd.throw_bone_in_tar) and wait until it's closed,
	then performs the animation.

	-Fix bug #539 "Early access to Domino's office" - ha.lua.patchr
	ha.enter() locks the door ha.do_door, which goes to Dom's office if Bruno was
	reaped but not Meche, but locking the door isn't enough. It must be explicitly
	closed - calling ha.do_door:close() - otherwise manny will just pass through it.
	As Manny shows, you can lock an open door, and while it is symbolically compelling,
	it doesn't close it. :)

	-Fix bug #672 "Meche's line "I'm sorry I let you down Manny" is played as Manny
	walks into the hallway." - mo.lua.patchr
	mo.ha_door.walkOut doesn't wait for Meche has finished speaking to move Manny outside
	his office. This patch adds a wait_for_message() to prevent this.

	-Fix bug #687 "GRIM: Getting down the conveyour-belt is very difficult." - cy.lua.patchr
	The function cy.climb_chain_box.walkOut checks if the chain is down and makes manny float
	if it is. But the chain may be down but not on the belt if the direction of movement
	of it is from the sea to the crane. This patch adds that missing check.

	-Fix bug #688 "GRIM: If Charlie removes sheet while in inventory, Manny gets stuck" - ly.lua.patchr
	The function ly.charlie_get_up_timer checks if the game is playing a cutscene,
	before launching the scene when Charlie removes the sheet, but it doesn't check if
	the inventory is open. This patch adds another check (with inInventorySet()) and waits
	the close of the inventory before starting the cutscene.

	-Fix bug #81 "Year 1 - Bone disappears from spider web - Glitch" - sp.lua.patchr
	In the sp set, the variable sp.web.has_bone is used to signal if there is a bone in the web,
	but it's not cleaned after that the Glottis' hearts has been launched.
	This patch set this variable to FALSE after that event (in the function sp.manny_hook_n_fling_web)

	-Fix the disappearing hat when opening the inventory with the nautical suit. -
		_inventory.lua.patchr
	The function open_inventory() stops the chore 'manny.hold_chore'. But that variable sometimes
	is nil, and that causes all the chores to be stopped, included the chore which shows the hat.
	This patch checks if 'manny.hold_chore' is not nil and only in that cases it stops it.
	In addition to this now we must also stop the chore 'ms_putback_deck' of ms.cos when putting back
	the cards deck, since that chore before this patch is stopped by stopping 'manny.hold_chore', being
	it nil. Not stopping it results in broken animation when getting the card from the deck.
	We must also stop the chore 'ms_putback_card' when putting the card for the same reason.

	-Fix a Lua error when speaking to Lupe with all the dialog options expired (#198) - dlg_lupe.lua.patchr
	When there are no more dialog options the dialog system calls a 'abort' line (Dialog.display_lines,
	in _dialog.lua) which should end the dialog, by setting the value of the 'node' variable to "exit_dialog".
	The other way of ending a dialog is to choose an exit line which is not an abort line but which
	also sets that variable.
	The line 'lu1.aborts.lun1' was making the dialog system call the exit line, instead of just calling
	the say_line() needed, and that in turn resulted in the function Dialog.display_lines be called two
	times with the node set as 'exit_dialog', and so the outro (lu1.outro) was called two times.
	More importantly the function 'start_script(lupe.new_run_idle, lupe, "jump_back")' was called two times,
	and that resulted in broken animation the next time Manny talked to Lupe.
	This patch modifies 'lu1.aborts.lun1', by not relying on the exit line anymore.

	Fix bug #237 "GRIM: The animation of when glottis gives manny the work order does not play correctly."
		- dlg_glottis.lua.patchr
	gl1[220].response calls the function 'glottis.hand_work_order', which manages the animation and then
	calls 'glottis:flip_ears(5)' after a 'wait_for_message()'. The flip_ears() call causes the chore
	'default_keys' of 'gl_akimbo_idles.cos' to be completed (Chore::setLastFrame), and that stops any
	keyframe component that costume has, including 'give_workorder.key'. This patch moves the flip_ears()
	call before the wait_for_message(), so that 'default_keys' is completed before 'give_workorder.key' starts.

	Fix the sequence of Bowlsley pointing the gun at Manny - fi.lua.patchr
	That sequence is broken in many ways: Bowlsley points the gun at the wall instead of at Manny; when Manny
	reaches for the cases he is too far from them and when Bowlsley sneaks out Manny turns too early,
	giving the impression he is moving one case to the floor, except thare's no case.
	This patch fixes all these issue, resulting in a much more good looking sequence.

	Fix bug #707 "Grim: Upper part of forklift not visible in the wc set" - forklift.cos.patchr
	The costume chores hide the meshes 17 (cage) and 12 (spout). This patch changes the values from 0 to 1
	in the chore keys.

	Fix bug #351 "GRIM: Sound of punching bag in Dom's office occurs before animation" - do.lua.patchr
	This patch modifies the function dom.bag.use, modifying some sleep_for() with better values.
	It does also remove some sleep_for() to improve the animation when punching the bag when it is still
	oscillating.

	Fix bug #300 "GRIM: Animation glitch upon breaking the Neon-Lady" - nl.lua.patchr
	The function nl.gargoyle.use_sproutella, after the call to play_movie("nl_crush.snm", 272, 0), waits for
	Manny's chore 'md_sproutella_sproutella' to finish, and that delays the start of the fullscreen movie.
	This patch just removes that wait.

	Fix bug #691 "GRIM: When Glottis starts driving in the Petrified Forest, the car pops into place." - sg.lua.patchr
	The function sg.get_in_BW calls 'sg:enable_bonewagon_boxes(TRUE)' to disable some sectors where the
	bone wagon cannot go, but it calls it only after the cut scene finishes. This patch moves that call
	at the start of the function.

	Fix bug #680 "GRIM: When emptying the turkey-baster into Naranja's drink it's full again." - ma_use_baster.cos.patchr
	The chore 0 (use_baster) of ma_use_baster.cos was hiding baster.3do (empty) and showing full_baster.3do (full)
	at the end of the chore. This patch keeps baster.3do visible, and hides full_baster.3do. In addition, this
	patch shows baster.3do and hides full_baster.3do after 600 ms instead of at time 0, so that the change actually
	happens when Manny squeezes his hand.

	Fix wrong sfx timing when emptying the turkey-baster into Naranja's drink - si.lua.patchr
	This patch adds a sleep_for(600) before the call to "start_sfx("tkBstSqt.wav")" so that the squeezing
	sound happens when Manny squeezes the baster.

	Fix bonewagon popping when driving in and out set tr. - tr.lua.patchr
	The function tr.drive_in() has a while loop that makes the bonewagon go forward until it's near the wanted
	position. The problem is that 'near' is 1, which is quite a lot. This patch modifies the loop so that it
	goes forward until, after the WalkActorForward call, he is nearer than before, so until it has not passed
	the destination.
	This patch also modifies tr.get_in_BW(), which is called only when the tree is still up, and adds a
	bonewagon:ignore_boxes(), since the function bonewagon.default(), which get_in_BW calls, enables the boxes for
	the bonewagon.

	Fix the DOD door animation and sound - lo.lua.patchr, os.lua.patchr, lo_os_door.cos.patchr, os_lo_door.cos.patchr
	When exiting the DOD the door is closed, then it plays the close animation. lo.lua.patchr adds a complete_chore
	call with the opening chore as argument before waiting for manny, and after which the close	chore is called.
	By completing the open chore though, the open sound was executed two times: one when opening the door in lo
	and one when completing the chore in os. The same happens when going from os to lo (and that happens with
	original too, since os calls the complete_chore). So lo_os_door.cos.patchr and os_lo_door.cos.patchr add a
	new chore 'open_fast' which just sets the open bitmap image. lo.lua.patchr and os.lua.patchr then call
	complete_chore with the new chores as argument.

	Fix bug #285 "GRIM: Showing the Lengua-card to the tattoo-guy, he faces wrong." - si.lua.patchr
	When using some objects on Toto and he is at the phone, the function 'si.interrupt_toto' is called, but it
	does not set Toto's head. This patch adds the needed call.

	Fix Toto talking before he picks up the phone - si.lua.patchr
	After interrupting Toto, the function 'si.toto_on_phone' is called, which restores the dialogue with Velasco.
	The problem is that it does not wait for Toto to finish turning towards the phone, so he starts speaking with
	Velasco before he has the phone. This patch adds some sleep_for calls before calling 'si.toto_on_phone'.

	Fix Toto not talking to Velasco anymore after Manny screams to Velasco - si.lua.patchr
	When Toto phones Velasco, Manny can 'use' Toto and he will scream to Velasco. After the sequence Toto does not
	resume his dialogue with Velasco: the script 'si.toto_on_phone' is stopped and is not started anymore.
	This patch adds the missing start_script call.

	Fix bug #622 "GRIM: pick-up telephone in Toto's building" - si.lua.patchr
	This patch hides the actor 'si.phone_actor' when Manny or Toto pick up the phone, since the costumes they use
	have a phone model which gets animated. This patch adds some 'si.phone_actor:set_visibility(TRUE/FALSE)' calls
	in a few places.

	Fix Manny's animations becoming stuck when he speaks to the woman at the phone while skipping dialogue lines
		- si.lua.patchr
	The function 'si.phone.use' handles the dialogue with the woman. It calls some gesture functions
	(e.g. manny:hand_gesture) which push a costume. If the dialogue lines are skipped that costume may not get
	popped out because meanwhile another one is pushed and popped. This patch adds a while loop which blocks
	the script until the gesture is finished.

	Fix walk sectors in set cf - cf.set.patchr
	It can be difficult to walk from behind Manny's desk to the center of the room, passing on the right,
	because of a narrow corridor, and a 'hole' in the walkable sectors. This patch resizes the sector "sect_66"
	to make more room and to fill the hole.

	Fix wrong Manny positioning when going from set ts to set tx - ts.lua.patchr
	The function ts.tx_door.walkOut calls 'tx:come_out_door' with the wrong door argument. This patch replaces
	it with the right door.

	Fix broken Manny's walk animation after opening Domino's safe - vd.lua.patchr
	The function 'vd.open_safe' plays the chore 50 (bend_get_scythe) of mn2.cos which starts some keyframes with
	the key '2' which means "play and endpause". This patch adds a 'manny:stop_chore' call after the chore has
	done.

	Fix Manny's walking backwards animation - ma_back_off.key.patchr
	The animation has 16 frames, but the 16th frame looks the same at the 15th one so we just say that it only
	has 15 frames.

	Fix #861 "GRIM: Year 4 - Character stuck on Aztec Temple" - tg.lua.patchr
	If the user hits the override key while manny is talking about the note, the override is never disabled, so
	we add the disable call.

	Fix #356 "GRIM: Velasco's reminiscences are cut off" - dlg_velasco.lua.patchr
	The function 're.fake_conversation' (re.lua) might possibly call out 'velasco:shut_up()' during Velasco's
	final line, causing it to get cut off.  Adding an additional 'wait_for_message()' in the dialog script removes
	that possibility.

+Untriggered contents:
	-Fix the missing dialogue with Domino at third year
	In dlg_dom2.lua, the argument of CheckFirstTime is wrong; this
	prevents the correct load of this script.
	See https://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=108

+Others modifications:
	-The function si.set_up_actors (si.lua), calls "start_script(si.naranja_drinking)",
	which doesn't exist. The problem with that is that lua_error ends the function that
	was going on, breaking si.set really badly. The bad call is removed, instead of being replaced
	with "start_script(si.naranja_drink)", which does exists, but which can cause Naranja to stutter
	when entering the set.

Contents of grim-patches.lab and its rebuild:

grim-patches.lab contains all .patchr files in the
dists/engine-data/patches/grim/ directory.
If you add a new patch in that directory, you have to update this file
with a detailed description of what that patch does.
Then you have to rebuild residualvm-grim-patches.lab with mklab from the
scummvm-tools repo. The rebuild command is (assuming that you are
launching it in dists/engine-data/):

 $ mklab --grim patches/grim grim-patch.lab

Please check that there aren't any files different from .patchr inside
that directory before the rebuild, so delete all junk, backup and system
files, like namepatch.patchr~, namepatch.patchr.bak, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db
and so on.
