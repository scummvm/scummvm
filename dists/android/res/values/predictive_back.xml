		Android 33 introduced the enableOnBackInvokedCallback with gesture based navigation.
		Sadly the implementation is incomplete before Android 34 to detect long presses on the back
		button.
		So, only enable the attribute starting with Android 34 as Android 33 works well with false.
		Note: in Android 33 with gesture navigation, the long "press" on back (aka slow back gesture)
		cannot be detected.
