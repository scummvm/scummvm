Custom Tab completions for the bash shell. This depends on the
bash-completion package. Consult the documentation for that for how to
enable this.

Example for how to enable it for a single user in Debian GNU/Linux:

If your ~/.bashrc was automatically generated, it probably contains
something like this:

    # enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable
    # this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profiles
    # sources /etc/bash.bashrc).
    # if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    #     . /etc/bash_completion
    # fi

Uncomment the last three lines. This will the custom tab completions
for everthing included in the bash-completion package.

Create ~/.local/share/bash-completions/completions if you don't
already have it, and copy the tab completion script (scummvm) to it.
Any newly started Bash shell should now have custom completions for
ScummVM.
