*** Release notes (limit is 500 characters):
This is the first pre-release version of ScummVM 2.8.0 for iOS.

There have been multiple bug fixes and new features for many of the supported games.
The iOS port has received some new features as:
- A default soundfont bundled with the application so users doesn't have to download one, unless they want a different one.
- More buttons on the virtual controller to allow for more keymappings in games depending on joysticks.
- A minimal layout of the virtual controller for games that doesn't need that many buttons
- NEON acceleration in some games (e.g. AGS games)

Happy testing
