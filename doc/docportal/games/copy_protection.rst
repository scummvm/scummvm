Copy protection
====================

The ScummVM team does not condone piracy. However, there are cases where the game companies themselves bundled 'cracked' executables with their games. In these cases the data files still contain the copy protection scripts, but the interpreter bypasses them - similar to what an illegally cracked version might do, only that here the producer of the game did it. There is no way for us to tell the difference between legitimate and pirated data files, so for the games where we know that a cracked version of the original interpreter was sold at some point, ScummVM has to bypass the copy protection.

In some cases ScummVM still shows the copy protection screen. Try entering any answer; chances are that it will work.

ScummVM skips copy protection in the following games:

- Beneath a Steel Sky. Bypassed with kind permission from Revolution Software.
- Dreamweb. 
- Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb (Floppy version). Bypassed with kind permission from Wyrmkeep Entertainment, since it was bypassed in all CD releases of the game.
- Loom (EGA DOS)
- Lure of the Temptress
- Maniac Mansion
- Might and Magic: World of Xeen
- Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge
- Rex Nebular and The Cosmic Gender Bender
- Simon the Sorcerer 1 (Floppy version)
- Simon the Sorcerer 2 (Floppy version). Bypassed with kind permission from Adventure Soft, since it was bypassed in all CD releases of the game.
- The Secret of Monkey Island (VGA)
- Voyeur
- Waxworks
- Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders
