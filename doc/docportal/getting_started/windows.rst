Downloading and installing ScummVM
-----------------------------------
The easiest way to install ScummVM is to download the Windows installer on the `ScummVM downloads page <https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/>`_. This installer will guide you through the install process, as well as adding a shortcut to the Start Menu. There is also an option to add a shortcut to the desktop.  

To run ScummVM, navigate to desktop and double click the ScummVM shortcut, or click for later Windows versions **Start > All Apps > ScummVM** or for Windows XP **Start > All Programs > Games > ScummVM**

Alternatively, you can download the Windows zipped file appropriate to your operating system (32bit or 64bit). To unzip the contents, right-click the folder, select Extract All, and then follow the instructions. To run ScummVM from this folder, find the ``scummvm.exe`` file and double click it. 

**Congratulations!**

ScummVM is now installed and ready for you to :doc:`add your games <../getting_started/adding_games>`!
