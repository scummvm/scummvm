Installing ScummVM
====================================

There are multiple ways to install ScummVM on your Android device depending on what version of Android you have.


Google Play Store
*********************
For Android 7 (Nougat) or earlier, the easiest way to install ScummVM is by downloading it from the Google Play Store. You will be guided through the installation. 

.. caution:: 

    Currently the Google Play version of ScummVM will not work on Android versions 8.0 and later. If your version of Android is not compatible with the app on the Google Play store, follow the instructions for installing ScummVM using the APK package. 

APK package install
**********************

On your device, use a web browser app to navigate to the `ScummVM downloads page <https://www.scummvm.org/downloads>`_. The recommended download section on the page should suggest the correct ``.apk`` package, however if it does not, scroll down to select the correct package. 

.. tip:: 

    To find the correct package for your device, you will need to know whether you are running a 32 or 64-bit operating system, and which chipset your device has. A quick internet search using your device model number should allow you to find these details.

Click on the correct package to start the download. Once it has downloaded, go to the file and tap on it to start the install process. Do this by using either a file manager app and navigating to the Downloads folder, or by selecting the file directly from the web browser downloads. The file manager or the web browser will ask for permission to install the package, and once permission has been granted, will return you to the install. 

.. note:: 

    The downloaded APK package is treated as an app from an unknown source, since it doesn't originate in the Google Play store. If you are having any problems with the install, you will need to allow unknown apps. 

    - For Android 7 or earlier, go to **Settings > Security > Device Administration**, scroll down to **Device Administration** and enable **Unknown Sources**.
    - For Android 8 or later, go to **Settings > Apps and Notification** and select **Install Unknown Apps**. 
    
Transferring game files 
========================================

You need to transfer all the required game data files to your device, into a folder accessible by the ScummVM app. 

ScummVM has built-in Cloud functionality, which allows you to connect your Google Drive, OneDrive, Box or Dropbox account. For more information, see the :doc:`../settings/cloud` page. ScummVM also has the ability to run a local web server. For more information, see the :doc:`../settings/lan` page. 

There are a few other options for transferring the game files:

 - Copying the files directly onto the microSD card, if your device has one.
 - USB transfer from a computer. To complete file transfer via USB cable, tap the **Charging this device via USB notification** when the device is connected. Select **Use USB for** and then **File Transfer**. An Android File Transfer window will open.   
 - Downloading games such as freeware games or those from digital distributors such `GOG.com <gog.com>`_  or `Steam <steam.steampowered.com>`_ directly to your device.

For more information on which files ScummVM requires, and how to add and play games, see `adding and playing games <adding_games>`_.
