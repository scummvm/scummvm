Android

Prerequisites
================

- An Android device running Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or newer.

.. note::

    ScummVM has been tested to work up to Android 10. Currently there are some file browsing limitations with Android 11. The ScummVM team are working to resolve these.  

Install ScummVM
====================================

There are two ways to install ScummVM on an Android device; install it from the Google Play Store, or manually download and install the APK package from the ScummVM downloads page. 

Google Play Store
*********************

Go to the Google Play Store to download and install ScummVM. 


APK package 
************

On your device, use a web browser app to navigate to the `ScummVM downloads page <https://www.scummvm.org/downloads>`_. The recommended download section on the page should suggest the correct ``.apk`` package, however if it does not, scroll down to select the correct package. 

.. tip:: 

    To find the correct package for your device, find out whether the device has a 32 or 64-bit operating system, and which chipset the device has. An internet search using the device model number should allow you to find these details.

Click on the correct package to start the download. Once it has downloaded, go to the file and tap on it to start the install process. Use either a file manager app, or select the file directly from the web browser downloads. The file manager or the web browser asks for permission to install the package, and once permission is granted, returns to the install. 

.. note:: 

    The downloaded APK package is treated as an app from an unknown source, since it doesn't originate in the Google Play store. To allow unknown apps:

    - For Android 7 or earlier, go to **Settings > Security > Device Administration**, scroll down to **Device Administration** and enable **Unknown Sources**.
    - For Android 8 or later, go to **Settings > Apps and Notification** and select **Install Unknown Apps**. 
    
Transfer game files 
========================================

Transfer all the required game data files to your device, into a folder accessible by the ScummVM app. 

ScummVM has built-in Cloud functionality, which allows you to connect your Google Drive, OneDrive, Box or Dropbox account. For more information, see the :doc:`../using_scummvm/connect_cloud` page. ScummVM also has the ability to run a local web server. For more information, see the :doc:`../using_scummvm/local_webserver` page. 

There are a few other options to transfer the game files:

 - Copy the files directly onto the microSD card, if the device has one.
 - USB transfer from a computer. To complete file transfer via USB cable, tap the **Charging this device via USB notification** when the device is connected. Select **Use USB for** and then **File Transfer**. An Android File Transfer window opens.   
 - Download games such as freeware games or those from digital distributors such `GOG.com <gog.com>`_  or `Steam <steam.steampowered.com>`_ directly to your device.

For more information on which files ScummVM requires, and how to add and play games, see :doc:`../using_scummvm/add_play_games`.
