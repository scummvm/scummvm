Understanding the interface
===================================

The Launcher
===============

The main ScummVM window is called the Launcher. The Launcher opens whenever you start ScummVM, unless you launch a game directly from the command line.

The games list
********************

The pane on the left is the games list, which lists all the games that have been added to ScummVM. The games list usually offers some additional information about each game, such as original platform and language. To highlight any game on the list, type the first letter(s) of its title, or click on it.


The search box
********************

The search box lets you filter the games list. It is located at the top of the page next to the magnifying glass icon. The filter is applied as you type, and is not case sensitive. To clear the filter, click **X**.

There are many ways to filter games. For example, you can type "Monkey Island" to locate all "Monkey Island" games on the list, or you can type "German" to find German games. 

The buttons
************************

To the right of the games list there are a number of buttons. Their functions are as follows:
