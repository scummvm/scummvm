Known problems
=====================

This release has the following known problems. There is no need to report them, although patches to fix them are welcome. If you discover a bug that is not listed here or in the `compatibility list <https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/>`_ on the ScummVM website, please see :doc:`reporting_bugs`.

- CD Audio Games:
    - When playing games that use CD Audio (FM-TOWNS games, Loom CD, etc) users of Microsoft Windows 2000/XP may experience random crashes. This is due to a long-standing Windows bug, resulting in corrupt game files being read from the CD. Please copy the game data to your hard disk to avoid this.

- FM-TOWNS versions:
    - The Kanji versions require the FM-TOWNS Font ROM.

- Loom:
    - Turning off the subtitles via the config file does not work reliably as the Loom scripts automatically turn them on again. MIDI support in the EGA version requires the Roland update from LucasArts.
    - The PC-Engine Kanji version requires the system card rom.

- The Secret of Monkey Island:
    - MIDI support in the EGA version requires the Roland update from LucasArts.

- Beneath a Steel Sky:
    - Amiga versions aren't supported.
    - Floppy demos aren't supported.
    - Not a bug: CD version is missing speech for some dialogs, this is normal.
