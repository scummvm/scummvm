The ScummVM log file
=====================

To help you report a bug, you can find error messages in the ScummVM log file. The location of this file varies depending on your operating system. 


.. tabbed:: macOS

	.. panels::
		:column: col-lg-12 mb-2

		``~/Library/Logs/scummvm.log``, where ``~`` is your Home directory.

.. tabbed:: Linux

	.. panels::
		:column: col-lg-12 mb-2

		We use the XDG Base Directory Specification, so by default the file will be ``~/.cache/scummvm/logs/scummvm.log`` but its location may vary depending on the value of the ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` environment variable. 

.. tabbed:: Windows
