Command line interface
=======================

Launching ScummVM from the command line allows you to pass a number of options, some of which override the applicable :doc:`global <../using_scummvm/global_settings>` or :doc:`game-specific <../using_scummvm/game_settings>` settings.

Some other options, such as ``--help`` or ``--list-audio-devices``, allow you to view information about ScummVM directly on the command line without opening the Launcher or starting a game. 

Short options are listed where they are available.

The meaning of most long options can be inverted by prefixing them with ``no-``. For example, ``--no-aspect-ratio`` will turn aspect ratio correction off.
