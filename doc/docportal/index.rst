====================
Welcome to ScummVM!
====================

ScummVM is a program that allows you to run classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have the game data files. ScummVM replaces the executable files shipped with the games, which means they can be played on systems they were never designed for!

SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion) is a utility that was used to create many of the famous LucasArts adventure games, such as Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island. It is the namesake of ScummVM, with VM meaning Virtual Machine.

While ScummVM was originally designed to run LucasArts' SCUMM games, over time support has been added for many other games.
