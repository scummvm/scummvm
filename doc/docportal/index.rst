====================
Welcome to ScummVM!
====================

ScummVM is a program that allows you to run classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have the game data files. ScummVM replaces the executable files shipped with the games, which means they can be played on systems they were never designed for!

SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion) is a utility that was used to create many of the famous LucasArts adventure games, such as Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island. It is the namesake of ScummVM, with VM meaning Virtual Machine.

While ScummVM was originally designed to run LucasArts' SCUMM games, over time support has been added for many other games.

The games!
============

One of the most commonly asked questions we get is, "Where do I get the games??". If you still have your old floppy discs and CDs lying around (and have a way to read them!), then you can use the game files from these original discs. For a list of which files you need for each game, check out the `Datafiles page <https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Datafiles>`__ on our wiki. 

If you haven't had a floppy disc or even a CD in your possession for a while, we have a `wiki page <https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Where_to_get_the_games>`_ dedicated to helping you find some games to play. As a quick summary, there are a few freeware games available for download on our website's `Downloads page <scummvm.org/downloads>`_, or there are digital distributors such as `GOG.com <gog.com>`_ and `Steam <https://store.steampowered.com/>`_. 

Make sure you check out the `compatibility list <https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/>`_ on our website and the `Supported Games page <https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Category:Supported_Games>`_ on our wiki before you buy a game, to ensure it can run with ScummVM.

Getting help
=============

ScummVM is still under development. While we do our best to make sure that as many games as possible can be completed with no major bugs, crashes can happen!
