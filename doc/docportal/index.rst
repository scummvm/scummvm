====================
Welcome to ScummVM!
====================

ScummVM is a program that allows you to run classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have the game data files. ScummVM replaces the executable files shipped with the games, which means they can be played on systems they were never designed for!

SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion) is a utility that was used to create many of the famous LucasArts adventure games, such as Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island. It is the namesake of ScummVM, with VM meaning Virtual Machine.

While ScummVM was originally designed to run LucasArts' SCUMM games, over time support has been added for many other games.

First steps
================
We have guides available to show you how to get ScummVM up and running: 

- :doc:`getting_started/mac_linux_windows`
- **Phones and Tablets**: :doc:`getting_started/ios` | :doc:`getting_started/android`



How do I...?
=============

So you have ScummVM installed, but now you need to know how to add and play some games! We have lots of useful information to help you out:

- **Understanding the interface**: :doc:`using_scummvm/the_launcher` 
- **Playing games**: :doc:`using_scummvm/adding_games` | :doc:`using_scummvm/save_load_games` | :doc:`using_scummvm/keyboard_shortcuts`
- **Settings**: :doc:`settings/how_to` 
 
The games!
============

One of the most commonly asked questions we get is, "Where do I get the games??". If you still have your old floppy discs and CDs lying around (and have a way to read them!), then you can use the game files from these original discs. For a list of which files you need for each game, check out the `Datafiles page <https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Datafiles>`__ on our wiki. 

If you haven't had a floppy disc or even a CD in your possession for a while, there are a few freeware games available for download on our website's `Downloads page <scummvm.org/downloads>`_, or there are digital distributors such as `GOG.com <gog.com>`_ and `Steam <https://store.steampowered.com/>`_. See the `compatibility list <https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/>`_ on our website and the `Supported Games page <https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Category:Supported_Games>`_ on our wiki before you buy a game, to ensure it can run with ScummVM. 


Advanced options
============================

For our more experienced users, ScummVM has a command line interface, as well as the ability to edit settings directly in a configuration file. 

:doc:`advanced_options/configuration_file` | :doc:`advanced_options/command_line`


Getting help
=============

ScummVM is still under development. While we do our best to make sure that as many games as possible can be completed with no major bugs, crashes can happen!

If you are having problems with any aspect of ScummVM, take a look at our help section.
