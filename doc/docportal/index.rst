====================
Welcome to ScummVM!
====================

ScummVM allows you to play classic graphic point-and-click adventure games, text adventure games, and RPGs, as long as you already have the game data files. ScummVM replaces the executable files shipped with the games, which means you can now play your favorite games on all your favorite devices.

So how did ScummVM get its name? Many of the famous LucasArts adventure games, such as Maniac Mansion and the Monkey Island series, were created using a utility called SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion). The 'VM' in ScummVM stands for Virtual Machine. 

While ScummVM was originally designed to run LucasArts' SCUMM games, over time support has been added for many other games: see the full list `here <https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Category:Supported_Games>`_. Noteworthy titles include Broken Sword, Myst and Blade Runner, although there are countless other hidden gems to explore.
