=====================
PlayStation Vita
=====================

This page contains all the information you need to get ScummVM up and running on a PS Vita.

What you'll need
=======================

- A homebrew-enabled PS Vita console with `Vitashell <https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases/tag/v2.02>`_ installed. How to enable homebrew is outside the scope of this documentation.

Installing ScummVM
======================================

The PS Vita package is available for download on the ScummVM `Downloads page <https://www.scummvm.org/downloads>`_.

Copy the ``.vpk`` to the PS Vita and install it using VitaShell.


Transferring game files
=======================

There are a few ways to transfer game files to the PS Vita.

Use VitaShell to transfer the files by USB or FTP, or use SD2Vita to transfer the files directly to the microSD card.

Folders containing game files can be copied anywhere on the SD card.

ScummVM on the PS Vita supports :doc:`cloud functionality <../use_scummvm/connect_cloud>`.

See :doc:`../use_scummvm/game_files` for more information about game file requirements.


Controls
=================

Default control map
*********************************

These controls can also be manually configured in the :doc:`Keymaps tab <../settings/keymaps>`. See the :doc:`../use_scummvm/keyboard_shortcuts` page for common keyboard shortcuts.

Keyboard and mouse support
****************************

Real bluetooth mice and keyboards work on the Vita and are supported by ScummVM. Go to **Settings > Devices** on the Vita home screen to pair your devices.

.. note::

    Not all bluetooth keyboards or mice pair successfully with the Vita. The ScummVM team tested the Jelly Bean BT keyboard and mouse combo (ASIN:B06Y56BBYP) and with the standalone Jelly Comb Bluetooth Wireless Mouse (ASIN:B075HBDWCF).

Touch support
****************

For multi-touch gestures, the fingers have to be far enough apart from each other that the Vita will not recognize them as a single finger, otherwise the pointer will jump around.

Touchpad mouse mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The touch control scheme can be switched in the global settings. Go to **Options > Control**:

    - When **Touchpad mouse mode** is off:

        - The touch controls are direct, which means the pointer always jumps to the finger position.
        - The rear touch pad is disabled.

    - When **Touchpad mouse mode** is on:

        - The touch controls are indirect. The finger can be far away from the pointer and still move it, like on a laptop touchpad.
        - The pointer speed setting in the :doc:`Control tab <../settings/control>` affects how far the pointer moves in response to a finger movement.
        - The rear touch pad is enabled.


The front touchscreen uses the direct mode by default, but this can be changed by editing the :doc:`configuration file <../advanced_topics/configuration_file>` with the following keyword:

.. _frontpanel:

*frontpanel_touchpad_mode*

When set to true, the touch controls on the front touchscreen are indirect.

Two finger tap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a two finger tap, hold one finger down and then tap with a second finger.


Two finger drag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hold down two fingers to initiate a drag-and-drop feature. The two finger drag simulates the left mouse button being held down.

- The first finger affects mouse motion during the drag, the second finger can be removed without affecting the drag.
- When the last finger is removed, the left mouse button is released and the drag is over.
- The second finger can be anywhere, it doesn't have to be close to the first finger, and it doesn't have to be put down simultaneously with the first finger.

Three finger drag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hold down the three fingers to initiate a drag-and-drop feature. The three finger drag simulates the right mouse button being held down.
