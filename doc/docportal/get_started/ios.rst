Install ScummVM
=====================
There are two methods to install ScummVM onto an iOS device, and the method use depends on whether or not the device is jailbroken. 

No Jailbreak
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method is a little complex, however it is currently the only way to install ScummVM onto an iOS device that is not jailbroken. While a rudimentary knowledge of the command line would be useful, the following instructions, if followed carefully, can be completed by anyone. 

Prerequisites
****************

- A Mac computer with Xcode installed. Xcode is a free App, available from the Mac App Store.
- An Apple Developer account. You can sign up for a free account on the `Apple Developer Member Center <https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/>`_ with your Apple ID. 
- The ScummVM `iOS Libraries <https://www.scummvm.org/frs/build/scummvm-ios7-libs-v2.zip>`_ downloaded. 

.. note::

    If you have a free Apple developer account, each build will only be valid for 7 days, which means you will need to repeat these steps and rebuild ScummVM every week.

Create the Xcode project
***************************

The first step is to download the repository containing the code required to build the app. The next steps require use of the command line. Go to **Applications > Utilities > Terminal** and copy and paste the following, then press :kbd:`return` :

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm.git

.. note::
    The default branch of the ScummVM repository will be the master branch. To build a specific version of ScummVM, checkout the appropriate branch. For example, to build version 2.2.0, use the following command:

    .. code-block::

        git checkout branch-2-2-0

If you haven't done so before now, open Xcode from the Applications folder, and accept the End User License Agreement. Starting Xcode for the first time will also install the command line tools required. 

The next step changes the present working directory and then generates the tools required to create the Xcode project.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd scummvm/devtools/create_project/xcode
    xcodebuild

The next command creates a new directory called ``build`` at the same level as the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../../../..
    mkdir build
    cd build

The present working directory will now be the new ``build`` directory. Extract the contents of the downloaded iOS libraries package into the build folder by using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    unzip ~/Downloads/scummvm-ios7-libs-v2.zip

.. note::

    In newer versions of macOS, the archive is extracted automatically. If this is the case, the ``unzip`` command will not work as expected. Instead, copy the contents of the ``scummvm-ios7-libs-v2`` folder into the ``build`` directory. It is simplest to do this in the Finder. 


Generate the Xcode project
*****************************

It's time to generate the Xcode project. Ensure the present working directory is still the ``build`` directory, and then run the following on the command line:

.. code::

    ../scummvm/devtools/create_project/xcode/build/Release/create_project ../scummvm --xcode --enable-fluidsynth --disable-nasm --disable-opengl --disable-theora --disable-taskbar --disable-tts --disable-fribidi

The resulting directory structure looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    Home
     |--scummvm
     '--build
         |-- include 
         |-- lib
         |-- engines
         '-- scummvm.xcodeproj

.. tip::

    To view the Home directory in the Finder, select **Go > Home** in the menu bar, or press :kbd:`command+shift+H`.

Open the ``scummvm.xcodeproj`` file from the Finder, or from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    open scummvm.xcodeproj

Build ScummVM
*****************

Once Xcode is open, connect a device to install ScummVM onto. At the top of the window, select **ScummVM-iOS** and then select the device you just connected. You will need to "Trust" the device for it to show up on the list of connected devices. 

.. figure:: ../images/ios/choose_device.gif

   
The last step before building ScummVM is to change the bundle identifier and manage signing. Click on the **scummvm** project in the left pane, and then click on **ScummVM - iOS** under **TARGETS**. On the menu bar above, click on **General**. Under **Identity** you should see a field labeled **Bundle Identifier**. Input a unique identifier in reverse-DNS format. This can be as simple as com.\ *yournamehere*. 

.. figure:: ../images/ios/identifier.gif


Next to **General**, click on **Signing & Capabilities**. Under **Signing**, tick the **Automatically manage signing** box, and select your developer account from the **Team** dropdown menu. 

.. figure:: ../images/ios/signing.gif

   

If you have not added your developer account to Xcode, do this now. Click **Add an Account** in the dropdown menu.

In the upper left-hand corner, press the play button to build ScummVM. When the build is finished, it launches on your connected device. 


Jailbreak
^^^^^^^^^^^^


Prerequisites
***************

- A jailbroken iOS device. How to jailbreak a device is outside the scope of this documentation.
- A file manager app such as Filza installed on the device.


Install ScummVM
*******************

Go to the `ScummVM downloads page <https://www.scummvm.org/downloads>`_ and download the recommended ``.deb`` or ``.ipa`` package. When the device asks how to open the file, choose Filza.

Ensure the package is saved somewhere in the ``/var/mobile/`` directory. It should default to ``/var/mobile/Documents/``, which is fine. Tap on the file and then tap **Install** in the upper right corner to install ScummVM.

Restart your device for the install to complete. 

Transfer game files 
========================

There are multiple ways to transfer game files to your iOS device. 

ScummVM has built-in cloud functionality, which allows you to connect your Google Drive, OneDrive, Box or Dropbox account. For more information, see the :doc:`../use_scummvm/connect_cloud` page. ScummVM also has the ability to run a local web server. For more information, see the :doc:`../use_scummvm/LAN` page. 

.. note::

 ScummVM's cloud functionality does not currently support iCloud, however it is possible to upload game folders to your iCloud and then use the Files app on your iOS device to copy these folders into the local ScummVM folder.

Another way to transfer files (for macOS Catalina and newer) to your device is by using the Finder while your device is connected to your Mac. In the Finder app on your Mac, navigate to **Locations** in the left pane, and click on the connected device. Click on **Files**, then drag the folder containing the game files into the **ScummVM** folder. For older versions of macOS, and for Windows users, file transfer can be done in iTunes.

Click and drag mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Simulates a left mouse click when you touch the screen. The mouse pointer drags to wherever you slide your finger, and releases where you lift your finger.

If you press down a second finger in this mode, it releases the simulated left mouse button, and presses down the simulated right mouse button. The right mouse button is released when you lift your finger again. 

.. _direct:

Direct mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mouse cursor is placed directly under where your finger touches the screen. 

.. _touchpad:

Touchpad mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mouse cursor doesn't stay underneath your finger. The cursor is moved around from its current position by the direction of your finger movement, just like a touchpad on a laptop.

Paths
=======

Saved games
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``/var/mobile/Library/ScummVM/Savegames/`` if the device is jailbroken, or ``Savegames/`` in the ScummVM folder for a non-jailbroken device. Access this folder via the Finder or iTunes. 

Configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``/var/mobile/Library/ScummVM/Preferences`` if the device is jailbroken, or ``Preferences`` in the ScummVM folder for a non-jailbroken device. Access this folder via the Finder or iTunes.
