=======================
Command line interface
=======================

Launching ScummVM from the command line lets you pass a number of options, some of which override the applicable global or game-specific settings. It also lets you launch straight into a game without going to the Launcher first.


Usage
=========

.. code-block::

    scummvm [option] [game]

- By default, executing ``scummvm`` on the command line starts the Launcher. 
- Specify a game or use ``--auto-detect`` to start a game directly.
- Some options, such as ``--help`` or ``--list-audio-devices``, allow you to view information about ScummVM directly on the command line without starting the Launcher or starting a game.


Starting a game
===============

To start a game on the command line, three options are possible.

For games that have previously been added to ScummVM:

.. code::

    scummvm <target>

For any supported games, even if they have not been added to ScummVM:

.. code::

    scummvm -p <path to game files> <game id>

or

.. code::

    scummvm -p <path to game files> --auto-detect

In all cases additional options can be specified on the command line, for example to specify the graphics mode or which saved game to load.

The ``target`` is a name assigned to a game added to ScummVM. It is also known as the ID in the GUI, and can be changed in the :ref:`Game Options <id>`. In the configuration file, this is the game name in square brackets. If the same game is added to ScummVM twice, it will have two different ``target`` names, and they can be configured differently. To see the list of configured targets:

.. code::

    scummvm --list-targets

The ``game id`` is a unique identifier for any game supported by ScummVM. To see a list of all supported games for your ScummVM release:

.. code::

    scummvm --list-games

Specify a ``target`` on the command line to use settings already configured for that target, unless different options are specified on the command line. There is no need to specify the path for the game files since this is already part of the target configuration.

Use the ``game id`` or ``--auto-detect`` to start games with default settings for any settings not specified on the command line. The path to the game file needs to be specified.

The full ``game id`` contains both an engine name and a game name. For example, the game id for Full Throttle is ``scumm:ft``, where ``scumm`` is the engine name. In many cases where there is no ambiguity, you can omit the engine name when specifying a ``game id`` on the command line. For example, both ``scumm:ft`` and ``ft`` can be used. However, if there is an ambiguity with the game name, the full ``game id`` must be used. For example, for Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis only ``scumm:atlantis`` can be used as there would otherwise be an ambiguity with ``cryomni3d:atlantis``.

        The following examples assume that the path to ScummVM is ``C:\Program Files\ScummVM\scummvm.exe``.

        ^^^^

        To run Monkey Island, fullscreen (``-f``), if the game has already been added to ScummVM under the `target` name `monkey1`:

        .. code-block::

            C:\Program Files\ScummVM\scummvm.exe -f monkey1



        To run Full Throttle, fullscreen (``-f``) and with subtitles enabled (``-n``), specifying the path to the game on a CD (``-p``):

        .. code-block::

            C:\Program Files\ScummVM\scummvm.exe -f -n -p "D:\resource" scumm:ft

.. tabbed:: macOS

    .. panels::
        :column: col-lg-12

        The following examples assume the path to the ScummVM app is ``Applications/ScummVM.app``.

        If you are unsure of the path to the app, drag the ScummVM app icon into the Terminal window. This prints the path to the ScummVM app.

        To run ScummVM from the command line, add ``/Contents/MacOS/scummvm`` to that path.

        ^^^^

        To run Monkey Island, fullscreen (``-f``), if the game has already been added to ScummVM under the `target` name `monkey1`:

        .. code::

            /Applications/ScummVM.app/Contents/MacOS/scummvm -f monkey1


        To run Full Throttle, fullscreen (``-f``) and with subtitles enabled (``-n``), specifying the path to the game on a CD (``-p``):

        .. code::

            /Applications/ScummVM.app/Contents/MacOS/scummvm -f -n -p "/Volumes/Full Throttle/resource" scumm:ft

.. tabbed:: Linux

    .. panels::
        :column: col-lg-12

        The following examples assume the path to ScummVM is ``/usr/games/scummvm``.

        ^^^^^^

        To run Monkey Island, fullscreen (``-f``), if the game has already been added to ScummVM under the `target` name `monkey1`:

        .. code::

            /usr/games/scummvm -f monkey1


        To run Full Throttle, fullscreen (``-f``) and with subtitles enabled (``-n``), specifying the path to the game on a CD (``-p``):

        .. code::

            /usr/games/scummvm -f -n -p /cdrom/resource scumm:ft

        .. tip::

            If ScummVM is on PATH, there is no need to enter the full path to ScummVM. Similarly, if a game is already added to the Launcher, there is no need to specify the path to the game.


Options
========

The meaning of most options can be inverted by prefixing them with ``no-``. For example, ``--no-aspect-ratio`` will turn aspect ratio correction off. This does not apply to short options.

Option parameters are shown below in capitals, and need to be replaced with real values.

Short options are listed where they are available.
