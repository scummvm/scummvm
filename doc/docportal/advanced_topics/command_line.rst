=======================
Command line interface
=======================

Launching ScummVM from the command line allows you to pass a number of options, some of which override the applicable global or game-specific settings. It also allows you to launch straight into a game without going to the Launcher first. 

Some options, such as ``--help`` or ``--list-audio-devices``, allow you to view information about ScummVM directly on the command line without starting the Launcher or starting a game. 

Usage
=========

.. code-block::

    scummvm [option] [game]

To launch ScummVM, enter the path to ScummVM. Optionally, follow this with any of the options documented below, and/or the path to the game you wish to start. If a game has already been added to the games list in the Launcher, you can pass the game id instead of the path to the game. 


.. tabbed:: macOS
    
    .. panels::
        :column: col-lg-12

        The following examples assume the path to the ScummVM app is ``Applications/ScummVM.app``. 
        
        If you are unsure of the path to the app, drag the ScummVM app icon into the Terminal window. This prints the path to the ScummVM app. 
        
        To run ScummVM from the command line, add ``/Contents/MacOS/scummvm`` to that path. 

        ^^^^

        To run Monkey Island, fullscreen (``-f``):

        .. code::

            /Applications/ScummVM.app/Contents/MacOS/scummvm -f monkey 


        To run Full Throttle, fullscreen (``-f``) and with subtitles enabled (``-n``), specifying the path to the game on a CD (``-p``): 

        .. code::

            /Applications/ScummVM.app/Contents/MacOS/scummvm -f -n -p/cdrom/resource/ft

.. tabbed:: Windows
    
    .. panels::
        :column: col-lg-12

        The following examples assume that the path to ScummVM is ``C:\Games\LucasArts\scummvm.exe``. 

        ^^^^

        To run Monkey Island, fullscreen (``-f``):

        .. code-block:: 

            C:\Games\LucasArts\scummvm.exe -f monkey
        
    

        To run Full Throttle, fullscreen (``-f``) and with subtitles enabled (``-n``), specifying the path to the game on a CD (``-p``): 

        .. code-block::

            C:\Games\LucasArts\scummvm.exe -f -n -pD:\resource\ft

.. tabbed:: Linux/Unix
    
    .. panels::
        :column: col-lg-12

        The following examples assume the path to ScummVM is ``/usr/games/scummvm``.
        
        ^^^^^^

        To run Monkey Island, fullscreen (``-f``):
        
        .. code::

            /usr/games/scummvm -f monkey 


        To run Full Throttle, fullscreen (``-f``) and with subtitles enabled (``-n``), specifying the path to the game on a CD (``-p``):

        .. code::

            /usr/games/scummvm -f -n -p/cdrom/resource/ft

        .. tip:: 

            If ScummVM is on PATH, there is no need to enter the full path to ScummVM. Similarly, if a game is already added to the Launcher, there is no need to specify the path to the game.

        
Options
========

The meaning of most options can be inverted by prefixing them with ``no-``. For example, ``--no-aspect-ratio`` will turn aspect ratio correction off. This does not apply to short options. 

Option parameters are shown below in capitals, and need to be replaced with real values.

Short options are listed where they are available.
