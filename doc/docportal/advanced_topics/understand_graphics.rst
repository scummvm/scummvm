Understanding the graphics settings
=====================================

This guide expands on the information contained on the :doc:`graphics settings <../settings/graphics>` page.

How do the graphics settings work together?
----------------------------------------------

The graphics mode, aspect ratio, and stretch mode settings work together to change the resolution and display of each game. The first setting applied to the image is the graphics mode, then the aspect ratio correction, and then the stretch mode setting. The only exception to this is OpenGL mode, which applies all settings in one pass to arrive at a final image.

Render modes are only applicable to some older games that were designed to be played on multiple systems, and lets us choose which system's graphics to replicate.


Graphics modes
---------------------------

The original game graphics are upscaled using different graphical filters, which are specialized algorithms used to ensure that low resolution pixel-art still looks good when it is displayed at a higher resolution.

If the game originally ran at a resolution of 320x200—which is typical for most SCUMM games—then using a graphics mode with a scale factor of 2x yields 640x400 graphics. A 3x scale factor yields 960x600.

There is always a speed penalty when using any form of filtering.

.. note::

    Not all platforms support all the graphics modes.

To switch between graphics modes, press :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt` and :kbd:`1` to :kbd:`8`.

OpenGL mode
**************

OpenGL graphics mode works a little differently to the other graphics modes. Instead of applying the aspect ratio and stretch mode settings one after the other (and after the graphics mode scaling has been applied), it does all the scaling and stretching in one step, going directly from the original game resolution to the final display resolution. OpenGL mode uses hardware rendering, instead of software rendering.

Output is controlled by your window size (or screen resolution if in full screen) and the stretch mode selected, as well as the **Filter graphics** option.



.. _aspect:

Aspect ratio correction
------------------------------------

Older games were designed to be run at 320x200 pixels, but on systems where each pixel was rectangular instead of square. This means that on modern systems these games look wider and flatter than they are supposed to. Aspect ratio correction duplicates lines of pixels to correct this.

For a game with an original resolution of 320x200, aspect ratio correction results in a resolution of 320x240.

.. figure:: ../images/graphics/aspect_ratio/no_aspect_ratio.png

    No aspect ratio correction applied.

.. figure:: ../images/graphics/aspect_ratio/aspect_ratio.png

    Aspect ratio correction applied. The moon is actually round, as it should be!

To toggle aspect ratio on and off, press :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+a`.

.. _stretch:

Stretch modes
----------------------


There are five stretch modes:

- Center: centers the image in the window.
- Pixel-perfect scaling: scales the image to the highest multiple of the game resolution that fits the window, or that fits the screen if in fullscreen mode. Any empty space is filled with black bars.

    - For example, a game with an original resolution of 320x200 with aspect ratio correction applied (320x240) and a 3x graphics mode, will be stretched to a multiple of 900x720 pixels: 1800x1440, 2700x2160 and so on.

- Fit to window: fits the image to the window, but maintains the aspect ratio and does not stretch it to fill the window.
- Stretch: stretches the image to fill the window
- Fit to window (4:3): fits the image to the window, at a forced 4:3 aspect ratio.

To switch between stretch modes, press :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+s`.

Render mode
-------------

For most games this setting will have no effect. For some of the older games that could be played on different systems and graphics cards, this control lets you decide which system you want ScummVM to reproduce.

Below are some of the common render modes, to illustrate how the render mode setting works.

Filter graphics
----------------

When enabled, ScummVM uses bilinear interpolation instead of nearest neighbor for the :ref:`aspect ratio <aspect>` and :ref:`stretch mode <stretch>`. It does not affect the graphics mode scaling unless OpenGL is selected, in which case it determines how the OpenGL scaling is done.

Nearest neighbor is a simple way to scale an image; each pixel becomes multiple pixels of the same color. While this preserves the sharper details in a pixel art image, it also creates "jagged" edges as the image is scaled up. Bilinear interpolation finds the average color between pixel color values and fills in missing pixel, which results in a "smoothed" image.

To toggle between bilinear interpolation and nearest neighbor, press :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+f`.

3D Graphics settings
---------------------

Vsync
*******
V-sync, or vertical sync, synchronizes the frame rate of the game with the monitor's refresh rate, or the video capture refresh rate. This helps to prevent screen "tearing", where the screen displays parts of multiple frames at once, which looks like a horizontal line where the image appears to split. 

This setting is enabled by default. 

Renderers
*********
There are three options for rendering 3D games: OpenGL, OpenGL with shaders, or software.

- OpenGL uses the graphics card (GPU) to render the game. 
- OpenGL with shaders also uses the GPU, but also uses shaders, if available, to render the game. Shaders are small programs running on the GPU which transform certain graphics inputs to outputs. They control things such as how the pixels are drawn on the 3D shapes. 
- The software option uses the computer's CPU, instead of a graphics card, to render the game.  

Not all render options are available for all games. If in doubt, leave the setting at **<default>**. 

Anti-aliasing
***************
Without anti-aliasing, the computer takes the color it finds at the center of the pixel, and applies that color to the entire pixel. This results in jagged, pixelated lines at the edges of objects. Anti-aliasing, in a nutshell, is how we get nice, smooth lines on a 3D game. 

Historically, anti-aliasing was done using a method called Supersampling. With this method, each frame is rendered behind-the-scenes to a higher resolution, and then downscaled to produce a much smoother, better looking image. Unfortunately, this method is very GPU-intensive, and too slow. 

Multisampling Anti-Aliasing, or MSAA for short, was developed as a much faster alternative; the computer renders as much of the image as possible without anti-aliasing, and then only applies anti-aliasing to the edges. It samples each pixel to find out where the edge is, and how to blend the colors to create a smooth edge. The numbered options in the ScummVM :doc:`../settings/graphics` tab (2x, 4x and 8x), refer to how many samples are taken. 8x MSAA produces a better image than 2x MSAA, but is also more GPU-intensive.
