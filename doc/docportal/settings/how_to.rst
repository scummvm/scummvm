How to change settings
=======================

From the Launcher
==================
The settings are arranged by subject, on different tabs:

:doc:`Game tab <game>` | :doc:`Engine tab <engine>` | :doc:`Graphics tab <graphics>` | :doc:`Control tab <control>` | :doc:`Keymaps tab <keymaps>` | :doc:`Audio tab <audio>` | :doc:`Volume tab <audio>` | :doc:`Midi tab <audio>` | :doc:`MT-32 tab <audio>` | :doc:`Paths tab <paths>` | :doc:`Misc tab <misc>` | :doc:`Cloud tab <cloud>` | :doc:`LAN tab <lan>` | :doc:`Accessibility tab <accessibility>` 

To change a setting globally, so that it affects all games, go to **Options** and select the tab containing the setting you would like to change.

To change a setting for just one game, select the game, then go to **Edit Game** and select the tab containing the setting you would like to change. To make the game use the settings on that tab instead of the global settings, select **Override global settings**.  

Not all settings are available for all games; for example, where there is no MIDI soundtrack for a game, there will be no MIDI or MT-32 tabs. 

In the configuration file
==========================

See the :doc:`configuration file <../advanced_options/configuration_file>` page for more information on how to do this. Configuration keywords are listed in the Settings pages below the description of each setting, in italics.
