The Graphics tab
-----------------

To change settings globally, go to **Options > Graphics**. To change settings for a game, select the game, then go to **Edit Game > Graphics**. 

Use the graphics tab to change how games look when they are played. 

For a comprehensive look at how to use these settings, check out our :doc:`../guides/understand_graphics` guide.

.. _render:

Render mode
	Changes how the game is rendered, which affects how the game looks.

.. _stretchmode:

Stretch mode
	Changes the way the game is displayed in relation to the window size.

	*stretch_mode* 

.. _ratio:

Aspect ratio correction
	If ticked, corrects the aspect ratio so that games appear the same as they would on original 320x200 resolution displays.

.. _fullscreen:

Fullscreen mode
	Switches between playing games in a window, or playing them in fullscreen mode. Switch between the two by using :kbd:`Alt+F5` while in a game.
