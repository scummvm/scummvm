Audio settings are found in four tabs:

:ref:`Audio <audiotab>` | :ref:`Volume <volumetab>` | :ref:`MIDI <miditab>` | :ref:`MT-32 <mt32tab>` 

For a comprehensive look at how to use ScummVM's extensive audio settings, check out our :doc:`../advanced_topics/understand_audio` guide. 

.. _audiotab:

The Audio tab 
-----------------

Use the audio tab to change the sound output for games.

.. figure:: ../images/settings/audio.png

    The Audio tab in the global settings

.. figure:: ../images/settings/audio_game.png

    The Audio tab in the game-specific settings.


,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,


.. _device:

**Preferred device (global settings)** or **Music device (game-specific settings)**
	Specifies the device ScummVM uses to output audio. When set to **<default>**, ScummVM automatically chooses the most appropriate option for the played game. If set to an MT-32 or a MIDI device, or if ScummVM chooses one of these automatically, the settings on the MT-32 or MIDI tabs also apply.

	*music_driver* 

.. _opl:

AdLib Emulator 
	Chooses which emulator is used by ScummVM when the AdLib emulator is chosen as the **Preferred device**.

	*opl_driver* 

.. _speechmute:

**Text and Speech**
	For games with digitized speech, this setting allows the user to decide whether to play the game with speech only, subtitles only, or both. 

	*speech_mute* 

	*subtitles* 

.. _talkspeed:

**Subtitle speed**
	Adjusts the length of time that the subtitles are displayed on screen. The lower the speed is set, the longer the subtitles are displayed.

	*talkspeed* 

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

.. _volumetab:

The Volume tab
-----------------

Use the volume tab to set the relative volumes for various sounds.


.. figure:: ../images/settings/volume_game.png

    The Audio tab in the game-specific settings.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,


.. _music:

**Music volume**
	Adjusts the volume of the music in the game. 

	*music_volume* 

.. _sfx:

**SFX volume**
	Adjusts the volume of the sound effects in the game.

	*sfx_volume* 

.. _speechvol:

**Speech volume**
	Adjusts the volume of the digitized speech in the game, if it has any.

	*speech_volume* 

.. _mute:

**Mute All**
	Mutes all game audio. 

	*mute* 

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

.. _miditab:


The MIDI tab 
------------------------------

Use the MIDI tab to change the settings of General MIDI devices.


.. figure:: ../images/settings/MIDI.png

    The MIDI tab in the global settings.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,

.. _gm:

**GM Device**
	Specifies a preferred General MIDI (GM) device, which ScummVM uses if the **Preferred device** is set to **<default>** and General MIDI playback is required.   

	*gm_device* 

.. _soundfont:

**Soundfont**
	Specifies the path to a soundfont file, if this is required by the GM device. 

	*soundfont* 

.. _multi:

Mixed AdLib/MIDI mode
	Combines MIDI music with AdLib sound effects. 

	*multi_midi* 

.. _gain:

**MIDI gain**
	Adjusts the relative volume of the MIDI music. This is only supported by some music devices.
	 
	*midi_gain* 

.. _fluid:


FluidSynth 
************************************************************************

Opens a new dialog, with three further tabs:
`Reverb`_ | `Chorus`_ | `Misc`_


.. figure:: ../images/settings/fluidsynth.png

    The FluidSynth dialog, from the MIDI tab.


_`Reverb`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reverberation, or reverb, describes the pattern of echoes and reflections that occur when a sound is heard in an enclosed closed space, such as a room or a concert hall. 

.. _revact:

Active
	If ticked, reverb is added to the software synthesizer output. 

	*fluidsynth_reverb_activate* 

.. _revroom:

Room
	Sets the room size, which determines how much reverb there is. 

	*fluidsynth_reverb_roomsize* 

.. _revdamp:

Damp
	Dampens higher-frequency reverb, which produces a warmer sound. 

	*fluidsynth_reverb_damping* 

.. _revwidth:

Width
	Sets the stereo spread of the reverb signal. 

	*fluidsynth_reverb_width* 

.. _revlevel:

Level	
	Sets the reverb output amplitude. 

	*fluidsynth_reverb_level*

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

_`Chorus`
^^^^^^^^^^^
The chorus effect thickens and colors the audio signal so that it sounds as if there are a chorus of instruments playing one part. 

.. _chact:

Active	
	If ticked, chorus effects are added to the software synthesizer output. 

	*fluidsynth_chorus_activate* 

.. _chnr:

N
	Sets the voice count of the chorus, in other words, how many instruments are playing one part.

	*fluidsynth_chorus_nr* 

.. _chlevel:

Level
	Specifies the output amplitude of the chorus signal.

	*fluidsynth_chorus_level* 

.. _chspeed:

Speed
	Sets the modulation speed of the output, in Hz.

	*fluidsynth_chorus_speed* 

.. _chdepth:

Depth
	Specifies the modulation depth of the chorus.

	*fluidsynth_chorus_depth* 

.. _chwave:

Type
	Specifies the chorus modulation waveform type. 

	*fluidsynth_chorus_waveform* 

,,,,,,,,,,,,,


_`Misc`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _interp:

Interpolation
	Sets the interpolation method used by the software synthesizer. 

	*fluidsynth_misc_interpolation* 

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,


.. _mt32tab:

The MT-32 tab 
----------------------------------------------------

Use the MT-32 tab to change the settings of MT-32 devices.


.. figure:: ../images/settings/MT32.png

    The MT-32 tab in the global settings.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,

.. _mt32:

MT-32 Device
	Specifies a preferred MT-32 device, which ScummVM uses if the **Preferred device** is set to **<default>** and MT-32 playback is required. 

	*mt32_device*

.. _nativemt32:

**True Roland MT-32 (disable GM emulation)**
	Enable this option only if you are using an actual Roland MT-32, LAPC-I, CM-64, CM-32L, CM-500 or other MT-32 compatible device. Note that this cannot be used in conjuntion with the Roland GS device option. 

	*native_mt32*

.. _gs:

**Roland GS device (enable MT-32 mappings)**
	 Enable this option if you are using a GS device that has an MT-32 map, such as an SC-55, SC-88 or SC-8820. Note that this cannot be used in conjunction with the True Roland MT-32 option.
