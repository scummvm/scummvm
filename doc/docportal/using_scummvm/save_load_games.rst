Saved games can be loaded directly from the Launcher without starting the game first, by selecting the **Load** button.

There are two views: list view and tile view. Click the list and tile icons at the bottom left of the window to toggle between the two.  . 

In list view, the pane on the left shows a list of your saved states. Click on a saved state to highlight it. The pane on the right shows information about the highlighted state such as timestamps, screenshots and playtime.

To load a saved game, highlight the saved state and click **Load**.

			The AppData folder is hidden. The steps to view hidden files and folders depends on the Windows version.

		We follow the XDG Base Directory Specification. This means our configuration can be found in ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/scummvm/saves/``

		If XDG_DATA_HOME is not defined or empty, ``~/.local/share/`` will be used, where ``~`` is your Home directory. 
		
		Note that ``.local`` is a hidden directory; to view it use ``ls -a`` on the command line. If you are using a GUI file manager, go to **View > Show Hidden Files**, or use the keyboard shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl + H`.

		If ScummVM was installed using Snap, the saves can be found at ``~/snap/scummvm/current/.local/share/scummvm/saves/``
