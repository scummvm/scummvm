How to change settings
=======================

From the Launcher
==================
The settings are arranged by subject, on different tabs:

:doc:`Game tab <../settings/game>` | :doc:`Engine tab <../settings/engine>` | :doc:`Graphics tab <../settings/graphics>` | :doc:`Control tab <../settings/control>` | :doc:`Keymaps tab <../settings/keymaps>` | :doc:`Audio tab <../settings/audio>` | :doc:`Volume tab <../settings/audio>` | :doc:`Midi tab <../settings/audio>` | :doc:`MT-32 tab <../settings/audio>` | :doc:`Paths tab <../settings/paths>` | :doc:`Misc tab <../settings/misc>` | :doc:`Cloud tab <../settings/cloud>` | :doc:`LAN tab <../settings/lan>` | :doc:`Accessibility tab <../settings/accessibility>` 

To change a setting globally, so that it affects all games, select :guilabel:`Options`  and then select the tab containing the setting you would like to change.

To change a setting for just one game, highlight the game in the games list, then select :guilabel:`Edit Game` and select the tab containing the setting you would like to change. To make the game use the settings on that tab instead of the global settings tab, tick **Override global settings**.  

Not all settings are available for all games; for example, where there is no MIDI soundtrack for a game, there will be no MIDI or MT-32 tabs. 

In the configuration file
==========================

See the :doc:`configuration file <../advanced_topics/configuration_file>` page for more information on how to do this. Configuration keywords are listed in the Settings pages below the description of each setting, in italics.
