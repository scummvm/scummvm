Keyboard Shortcuts
===================

ScummVM supports various in-game keyboard shortcuts. 

.. note::

  Using Ctrl+f or Ctrl+g is not recommended. Games can crash when being run faster than their normal speed, as scripts will lose synchronisation.



Common::

    Ctrl+F5                - Displays the Global Menu
    Cmd+q                  - Quit (Mac OS X)

                             resolution, which may look squashed on
                             modern monitors. Aspect-ratio correction
                             stretches the image to use 320x240 pixels
