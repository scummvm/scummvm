=============
Game settings
=============

Each game can be configured to run using settings other than the :doc:`global_settings`

To open the game settings window, highlight a game in the main Launcher
window, and click on **Edit Game**. This window also opens any time a
game is added to the Launcher.


There are many settings, and they are separated into tabs:

`Game tab`_ | `Engine tab`_ | `Graphics tab`_ | `Audio tab`_ | `Volume tab`_ | `Midi tab`_ | `MT-32 tab`_ | `Paths tab`_ |

Settings may also be edited directly in the configuration file. These configuration keywords are listed below in italics. For more information, including a complete list of configuration keywords, see the :doc:`../advanced_options/configuration_file` .

_`Game tab`
------------

Use the game tab to display and change information about how the game is
identified by ScummVM.

	*gameid* 

.. _description:

**Name**
	This field shows the full title of the game, as well as some basic information such as original platform and language.
	 
	*description* 

.. _lang:

**Language**
	For multi-language games, this option changes the language of the game. However, for games that have the language hardcoded, this option only changes the font of the subtitles. For instance, selecting German will add an umlaut to German subtitles, and selecting Spanish will add the tilde in Spanish subtitles.
