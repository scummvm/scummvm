=============
Game settings
=============

Each game can be configured to run using settings other than the :doc:`global_settings`

To open the game settings window, highlight a game in the main Launcher
window, and click on **Edit Game**. This window also opens any time a
game is added to the Launcher.


There are many settings, and they are separated into tabs:

`Game tab`_ | `Engine tab`_ | `Graphics tab`_ | `Audio tab`_ | `Volume tab`_ | `Midi tab`_ | `Paths tab`_ |

Settings may also be edited directly in the configuration file. These configuration keywords are listed below in italics. For more information, see :doc:`../advanced_options/configuration_file` .
