The games list
===============

The pane on the left lists the games you have added to ScummVM. This list usually offers some additional information about each game, such as original platform and language. To highlight any game on the list, type the first letter(s) of its title, or click on it.


Quick search
=============

Quick search allows you to filter the list of added games. 
The quick search input is located at the top of the page next to the magnifying glass icon. The filter is applied as you type, and is not case sensitive. To clear the filter, select the **X** button next to the input box. 

There are many ways to filter games. For instance, you can type "Monkey Island" to quickly locate all "Monkey Island" games on the list, or you can type "German" if you wish to play a game in German.
