Global settings
===============

Games will follow the global game settings unless `game-specific
settings <using/game_settings>`__ are applied.

To open the global settings window, click **Options** in the main
Launcher window.

There are many settings, and they are separated into tabs:

`Graphics tab`_ | `Audio tab`_ | `Volume tab`_ | `Midi tab`_ | `MT-32 tab`_ | `Paths tab`_ | `Misc tab`_ | `Cloud tab`_ | `LAN tab`_ | `Accessibility tab`_ |

Settings may also be edited directly in the configuration file. These configuration keywords are listed below in italics. For more information, see :doc:`../advanced_options/configuration_file` .
