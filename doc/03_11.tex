\subsection{Known Problems in ScummVM 0.9.0CVS}

This release has the following known problems. There is no need to report them,
although patches to fix them are welcome. If you discover a bug that is not
listed here, nor in the compatibility table on the web site, please see
section \ref{sect-reporting-bugs}.

CD Audio Games:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When playing games that use CD Audio (Towns variants, Loom CD, etc),
                 users of Microsoft Windows 2000/XP may experience random crashes.
                 This is due to a long-standing Windows bug, resulting in corrupt
                 game files being read from the CD. Please copy the game data to
                 your harddrive to avoid this.
