ResidualVM Patch (patchr)

The ResidualVM Patch (patchr) is a binary patch engine, useful for small changes in games files.
Its mainly used to fix bugs in scripts of games, when the distribution of patched script is
forbidden due to copyright. The patching is done in ram, after the file is loaded, before the file
it's provided to the engine.

A patch come in form of a textual file, with .patchr extension. The filename must match the file that
you want to patch (for example, the patch of dlg_dom2.lua has to be called dlg_dom2.lua.patchr).
The patch came as sequence of instruction, one per line. An instruction is composed by a keyword, followed by
the arguments, separated by spaces (INST ARG1 ARG2 ....). Patchr is incase-sensitive; numerical arguments
are hexadecimal (without the 0x prefix).
A sharp (#) starts a comment, at every position in a line. The comment end with a newline.

A block of instructions must be enclused between a BEGIN and an END statements (see their description below)

Availables instructions:

-BEGIN
Args: md5
Indicates the start of a block of instructions. It takes the MD5 sum of the original flawed file as
argument. This sum is performed only on the firsts 5000 bytes of the file. Under an unix system it could be
calculated with:
dd if=FILENAME count=5000 bs=1 2> /dev/null | md5sum | cut -d" " -f 1
Every block must be terminated by an END statement.
If there are multiple different versions of the original file, you could provied differents patching instructions
with a block for each version. The right instruction sequence is selected by the MD5.

-END
Args: None
This statement close a sequence of instructions; it follows every BEGIN.

-REPLACE
Args: offset byte1 [byte2 ... byteN]
It changes the N bytes at the position specified by offset, with those specified by byte1 ... byteN.
The bytes in the new sequence have to be separed by spaces (1A 1B ok, 1A1B wrong).
The total size of file is not changed.

-FILL
Args: offset size byte
It's similar to REPLACE, it overwrite the bytes in the range [offset,offset + size) with the one specified by 'byte'.
The total size of file is not changed.

-COPY
Args: offset size dest_offset
Copy the region in the range [offset,offset + size) to dest_offset. The destination region is overwritten and
the total size of file is not changed.

-INSERT
Args: offset size
It expand the size of file by the amount specified by size, by inserting 'size' bytes at 'offset'. These bytes are
uninitialized, so a REPLACE, FILL or COPY are required.

-DELETE
Args: offset size
It shrinks the dimension of the file by the amount specified by size, by deleting 'size' bytes at 'offset'.

Example:

#This is a comment!

#Version 1
BEGIN 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef		#A begin with the checksum of the file
INSERT 100 100								#Insert 256 bytes at 0x100
FILL 100 80 FF								#Fill the first half with FF
REPLACE 180 AA BB CC						#Insert a specific sequence
COPY 0 10 183								#Copy 16 bytes from the start of the file
DELETE 0 10									#Delte the copied sequence
END											#The end of the chunk

#Version 2
BEGIN fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210		#A begin with the checksum of the file of another version
INSERT 200 100								#The same instructions with a different offset
FILL 200 80 FF
REPLACE 280 AA BB CC
COPY 0 10 283
DELETE 0 10
END

Debugging:
If you start ResidualVM with the command-line option --debugflags=patchr, it will print some debug information.
It will also dump a patched version of the modified files, so you can inspect your work.
