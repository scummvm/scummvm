\subsection{Playing sound with MIDI emulation}

Some games (such as Sam and Max) only contain MIDI music data.  This once
prevented music for these games from working on platforms that do not support
MIDI, or soundcards that do not provide MIDI drivers (e.g, many soundcards will
not play MIDI under Linux). ScummVM can now emulate MIDI mode using sampled
waves and Adlib emulation using the -eadlib option.  However, if you are capable
of using native MIDI, we recommend using one of the MIDI modes below for best
sound.
