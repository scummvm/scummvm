## 1.0) Introduction

### 1.1) About ScummVM

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical
point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data
files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables
shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which
they were never designed\!

Originally it was designed to run LucasArts' SCUMM games, such as Maniac
Mansion, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle or Sam and Max. SCUMM stands
for 'Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion', which was the first
game for which LucasArts designed this system. And much later it gave
its name to ScummVM ('VM' meaning Virtual Machine).

Over time support for a lot of non-SCUMM games has been added, and
ScummVM now also supports many of Sierra's AGI and SCI games (such as
King's Quest 1-7, Space Quest 1-6, ...), Discworld 1 and 2, Simon the
Sorcerer 1 and 2, Beneath A Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress, Broken
Sword I and II, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Gobliiins 1-3, The Legend of
Kyrandia series, many of Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM
games (including Freddi Fish and Putt Putt games) and many more. You can
find a full list with details on which adventures are supported and how
well on the compatibility page. ScummVM is continually improving, so
check back often.

Among the systems on which you can play those games are regular desktop
computers (running Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, ...), game consoles
(Dreamcast, Nintendo DS & Wii, PS2, PSP, ...), smartphones (Android,
iPhone, Symbian ...) and more.

At this time ScummVM is still under heavy development. Be aware that
whilst we attempt to make sure that many games can be completed with few
major bugs, crashes can happen and we offer no warranty. That being
said, some of the games have been supported for a long time and should
work fine with any recent stable release. You can get a feeling of how
well each game is working in ScummVM by looking at the compatibility
page. Actually, if you browse a bit around you might discover that
ScummVM is even being used commercially to re-release some of the
supported games on modern platforms. This shows that several companies
are happy with the quality of the software and how well it can run some
of the games.

If you enjoy ScummVM feel free to donate using the PayPal button on the
ScummVM homepage. This will help us buy utilities needed to develop
ScummVM easier and quicker. If you cannot donate, help and contribute a
patch\!

### 1.2) Quick start

For the impatient among you, here is how to get ScummVM running in five
simple steps.

1.  Download ScummVM from <https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/> and
    install it.

2.  Create a directory on your hard drive and copy the game datafiles
    from the original media to this directory. Repeat this for every
    game you want to play.

3.  Start ScummVM, choose 'Add game', select the directory with the game
    datafiles (do not try to select the datafiles themselves\!) and
    press `Choose`.

4.  A dialog should pop up allowing you to configure various settings if
    you wish to (it should be just fine to leave everything at its
    default, though). Confirm the dialog.

5.  Select the game you want to play in the list, and press `Start`.

In the future, you should be able to directly skip to step 5, unless you
want to add more games.

Hint: If you want to add multiple games in one go, try pressing and
holding the shift key before clicking 'Add game' -- its label will
change to 'Mass Add' and if you press it, you are again asked to select
a directory, only this time ScummVM will search through all
subdirectories for supported games.

### 1.3) F.A.Q.

We've compiled a list of F.A.Q. at:

<https://www.scummvm.org/faq/>

## 2.0) Contact

The easiest way to contact the ScummVM team is by submitting bug reports
(see section 2.1) or by using our forums at <https://forums.scummvm.org>.
You can also join and e-mail the scummvm-devel mailing list, or chat
with us on IRC (\#scummvm on irc.freenode.net) Please do not ask us to
support an unsupported game -- read the FAQ on our web site first.

### 2.1) Reporting Bugs

To report a bug, please follow the "Bug Tracker" link from our homepage
and log in with your GitHub account. Please make sure the bug is
reproducible, and still occurs in the latest git/Daily build version.
Also check the known problems list (below) and the compatibility list on
our website for that game, to ensure the issue is not already known:

<https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/>

Please do not report bugs for games that are not listed as being
completeable in the 'Supported Games' section, or compatibility list. We
_know_ those games have bugs.

Please include the following information:

  - ScummVM version (PLEASE test the latest git/Daily build)
  - Bug details, including instructions on reproducing
  - Language of game (English, German, ...)
  - Version of game (talkie, floppy, ...)
  - Platform and Compiler (Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, ...)
  - Attach a saved game if possible - If this bug only occurred
    recently, please note the last version without the bug, and the
    first version including the bug. That way we can fix it quicker by
    looking at the changes made.

Finally, please report each issue separately; do not file multiple
issues on the same ticket. (Otherwise, it gets difficult to track the
status of each individual bug).

The following games are based on the SCUMM engine, but NOT supported by
ScummVM (yet):

    Moonbase Commander

Please be aware that the engines may contain bugs and unimplemented
features that sometimes make it impossible to finish the game. Save
often, and please file a bug report (instructions on submitting bug
reports are above) if you encounter such a bug in a 'supported' game.

### 3.1) Copy Protection

The ScummVM team does not condone piracy. However, there are cases where
the game companies (such as LucasArts) themselves bundled 'cracked'
executables with their games -- in these cases the data files still
contain the copy protection scripts, but the interpreter bypasses them
(similar to what an illegally cracked version might do, only that here
the producer of the game did it). There is no way for us to tell the
difference between legitimate and pirated data files, so for the games
where we know that a cracked version of the original interpreter was
sold at some point, ScummVM will always have to bypass the copy
protection.

In some cases ScummVM will still show the copy protection screen. Try
entering any answer. Chances are that it will work.

ScummVM will skip copy protection in the following games:

  - Beneath a Steel Sky
      - bypassed with kind permission from Revolution Software.
  - Dreamweb
      - a list of available commands in the in-game terminals is now
        shown when the player uses the `help` command
  - Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb (Floppy version)
      - bypassed with kind permission from Wyrmkeep Entertainment, since
        it was bypassed in all CD releases of the game.
  - Loom (EGA DOS)
  - Lure of the Temptress
  - Maniac Mansion
  - Might and Magic: World of Xeen
  - Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge
  - Rex Nebular and The Cosmic Gender Bender
  - Simon the Sorcerer 1 (Floppy version)
  - Simon the Sorcerer 2 (Floppy version)
      - bypassed with kind permission from Adventure Soft, since it was
        bypassed in all CD releases of the game.
  - The Secret of Monkey Island (VGA)
  - Voyeur
  - Waxworks
  - Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders

### 3.2) Datafiles

For a comprehensive list of required Datafiles for supported games
visit:

<https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles>

### 3.3) Multi-CD games notes

In general, ScummVM does not deal very well with Multi-CD games. This is
because ScummVM assumes everything about a game can be found in one
directory. Even if ScummVM does make some provisions for asking the user
to change CD, the original game executables usually installed a small
number of files to the hard disk. Unless these files can be found on all
the CDs, ScummVM will be in trouble.

Fortunately, ScummVM has no problems running the games entirely from
hard disk, if you create a directory with the correct combination of
files. Usually, when a file appears on more than one CD you can pick
either of them.

### 3.4) Known Problems

This release has the following known problems. There is no need to
report them, although patches to fix them are welcome. If you discover a
bug that is not listed here, nor in the compatibility list on the web
site, please see the section on reporting bugs.

CD Audio Games:

  - When playing games that use CD Audio (FM-TOWNS games, Loom CD, etc)
    users of Microsoft Windows 2000/XP may experience random crashes.
    This is due to a long-standing Windows bug, resulting in corrupt
    game files being read from the CD. Please copy the game data to your
    hard disk to avoid this.

FM-TOWNS versions:

  - The Kanji versions require the FM-TOWNS Font ROM.

Loom:

  - Turning off the subtitles via the config file does not work reliably
    as the Loom scripts automatically turn them on again.
  - MIDI support in the EGA version requires the Roland update from
    LucasArts.
  - The PC-Engine Kanji version requires the system card rom.

The Secret of Monkey Island:

  - MIDI support in the EGA version requires the Roland update from
    LucasArts.

Beneath a Steel Sky:

  - Amiga versions aren't supported.
  - Floppy demos aren't supported.
  - Not a bug: CD version is missing speech for some dialogs, this is
    normal.

Elvira - Mistress of the Dark:

  - No music in the Atari ST version.

Elvira II - The Jaws of Cerberus

  - No music in the Atari ST version.
  - No sound effects in the PC version.
  - Palette issues in the Atari ST version.

Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb:

  - Amiga versions aren't supported.

Lure of the Temptress:

  - No Roland MT-32 support.
  - Sound support is incomplete and doesn't sound like original.

Simon the Sorcerer 1:

  - Subtitles aren't available in the English and German CD versions as
    they are missing the majority of subtitles.

Simon the Sorcerer 2:

  - Combined speech and subtitles will often cause speech to be cut off
    early, this is a limitation of the original game.
  - Only default language (English) of data files is supported in Amiga
    and Macintosh versions.

Simon the Sorcerer's Puzzle Pack:

  - No support for displaying, entering, loading or saving high scores.
  - No support for displaying names of items, when hovering over them in
    Swampy Adventures.

The Feeble Files:

  - Subtitles are often incomplete, they were always disabled in the
    original game.

The Legend of Kyrandia:

  - No music or sound effects in the Macintosh floppy versions.
  - Macintosh CD is using included DOS music and sound effects.

Humongous Entertainment games:

  - Only the original load and save interface can be used.
  - No support for multiplayer or printing images.

### 3.5) Extra Data Files

Some games require additional files that are not part of the original data. Those files can generally be found in our [Downloads](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#extras) page.

Games that require additional data:
  - Beneath a Steel Sky (sky.cpt)
  - Flight of the Amazon Queen
  - Kyrandia Series (kyra.dat)
  - Lands of Lore Series (kyra.dat)
  - Lure of the Temptress (lure.dat)
  - Versailles 1685 (cryomni3d.dat)

The most up to date list of Engine data files can be found in our [source code repository](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/tree/master/dists/engine-data)

### 3.6) Blade Runner notes

Supported versions are English (both CD and DVD), French, German,
Italian, Russian (by Fargus Multimedia) and Spanish. Other unofficial
versions exist but they are based on the English version.

All *.mix, *.tlk and *.dat files are needed from all 4 CDs/DVD.
Files named CDFRAMES.DAT need to be renamed to CDFRAMES1.DAT,
CDFRAMES2.DAT, CDFRAMES3.DAT and CDFRAMES4.DAT according on
the CD they came from. Other files with the same name on different
CDs are identical and it doesn't matter which one is used.

To enable subtitles, download a file from our [Downloads](https://www.scummvm.org/games/#bladerunner) page
and place file SUBTITLES.MIX next to the other game files.

"Blade Runner with restored content" is not yet supported and might
contain game breaking bugs.

### 3.7) Broken Sword games notes

The instructions for the Broken Sword games are for the Sold-Out
Software versions, with each game on two CDs, since these were the
versions most easily available at the time ScummVM gained support for
them. Hopefully they are general enough to be useful to other releases
as well.

#### 3.7.1) Broken Sword

For this game, you will need all of the files from the clusters
directories on both CDs. For the Windows and Macintosh versions, you
will also need the speech.clu files from the speech directories, but
since they are not identical you will need to rename them speech1.clu
and speech2.clu for CD 1 and 2 respectively. The PlayStation version
requires the speech.tab, speech.dat, speech.lis, and speech.inf.

In addition, the Windows and Macintosh versions require a music
subdirectory with all of the files from the music subdirectories on both
CDs. Some of these files appear on both CDs, but in these cases they are
either identical or, in one case, so nearly identical that it makes
little difference. The PlayStation version requires tunes.dat and
tunes.tab.

#### 3.7.2) Broken Sword II

For this game, you will need all of the files from the clusters
directories on both CDs. (Actually, a few of them may not be strictly
necessary, but the ones that I'm uncertain about are all fairly small.)
You will need to rename the speech.clu and music.clu files speech1.clu,
speech2.clu, music1.clu and music2.clu so that ScummVM can tell which
ones are from CD 1 and which ones are from CD 2. Any other files that
appear in both cluster directories are identical. Use whichever you
like.

In addition, you will need the cd.inf and, optionally, the startup.inf
files from the sword2 directory on CD 1.

#### 3.7.3) Broken Sword games cutscenes

The cutscenes for the Broken Sword games have a bit of a history (see
the next section, if you are interested), but in general all you need to
do is to copy the .SMK files from the "SMACKS" or "SMACKSHI" directories
on the CDs to the same directory as the other game data files. (Broken
Sword has a "SMACKSLO" directory with the same cutscenes, but these are
of lower quality.) You can put them in a subdirectory called "video" if
you find that neater.

For the PlayStation versions, you can dump the original videos off the
disc. For each of the files ending in an "STR" extension, you should
dump them as *raw* sectors off the disc (all 2352 bytes per sector). You
may also use the re-encoded cutscenes mentioned below instead, but this
will not work for all videos in Broken Sword II. For more information,
see:

<https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-PlayStation_Videos>

Some re-releases of the games, as well as the PlayStation version, do
not have Smacker videos. Revolution Software has kindly allowed us to
provide re-encoded cutscenes for download on our website:

<https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/>

These cutscenes are provided in DXA format with FLAC audio. Their
quality is equal to the original games due to the use of lossless
compression. Viewing these cutscenes requires a version of ScummVM
compiled with both FLAC and zlib support.

For systems that are too slow to handle the decoding of FLAC audio, the
audio for these cutscenes is also provided separately as OGG Vorbis
audio. Viewing these cutscenes with OGG Vorbis audio requires a version
of ScummVM compiled with both libVorbis and zlib support.

For Broken Sword, we also provide a subtitles add-on. Simply unpack it
and follow the instructions in its readme.txt file. The subtitle pack
currently does not work when running PlayStation videos. (Broken Sword
II already has subtitles; no extra work is needed for them.)

#### 3.7.4) Broken Sword games cutscenes, in retrospect

The original releases of the Broken Sword games used RAD Game Tools's
Smacker(tm) format. As RAD was unwilling to open the older legacy
versions of this format to us, and had requested we not reverse engineer
it, an alternative solution had to be found.

In Broken Sword II, it was possible to play back the voice-over without
playing the video itself. This remained a fallback until ScummVM 1.0.0,
but was never the only solution for any stable release.

In ScummVM 0.6.0 we used MPEG, which provided a reasonable trade-off
between size and quality. In ScummVM 0.10.0 this was superseded by DXA
(originally added for AdventureSoft's "The Feeble Files"). This gave us
a way of providing the cutscenes in the exact same quality as the
originals, at the cost of being larger.

Finally, in early 2006, the Smacker format was reverse engineered for
the FFmpeg project. Thanks to their hard work, ScummVM 1.0.0 now
supports the original cutscenes. At the same time, MPEG support was
dropped. From a technical standpoint, this was a good thing since
decoding MPEG movies added a lot of complexity, and they didn't look as
good as the Smacker and DXA versions anyway.

### 3.8) Day of the Tentacle notes

At one point in the game, you come across a computer that allows you to
play the original Maniac Mansion as an easter egg. ScummVM supports
this, with a few caveats:

ScummVM will scan your configuration file for a game that's in a
`Maniac` sub-folder of your Day of the Tentacle folder. If you've copied
the data files from the CD version, this should already be the case but
you have to add the game to ScummVM as well.

To return to Day of the Tentacle, press F5 and select "Return to
Launcher".

This means that you could in theory use any game as the easter egg.
Indeed, there is a "secret" configuration setting, `easter_egg`, to
override the ID of the game to run. Be aware, though, that not all games
support returning to the launcher, and setting it up to use Day of the
Tentacle itself as the easter egg game is not recommended.

### 3.9) Dragon History notes

There are 4 language variants of the game: Czech, English, Polish and
German. Each of them is distributed in a separate archive. The only
official version is the Czech one, and the English, Polish and German
ports have always been work in progress and never officially released.
Although all texts are fully translated, it is known that some of them
contain typos.

There exists an optional Czech dubbing for the game. For bandwidth
reasons, you can download it separately and then unpack it to the
directory of the game. You can listen to the Czech dubbing with all
language variants of the game, while reading the subtitles.

All game files and the walkthrough can be downloaded from:

<http://www.ucw.cz/draci-historie/index-en.html>

### 3.10) Flight of the Amazon Queen notes

Only the original non-freeware version of Flight of the Amazon Queen
(from original CD), requires the `queen.tbl` datafile (available from the `Downloads` page on our website) in either the
directory containing the `queen.1` game data file, in your extrapath, or
in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides.

Alternatively, you can use the `compress_queen` tool from the tools
package to 'rebuild' your FOTAQ data file to include the table for that
specific version, and thus removing the run-time dependency on the
`queen.tbl` file. This tool also allows you to compress the speech and
sound effects with MP3, OGG or FLAC.

### 3.11) Gobliiins notes

The CD versions of the Gobliiins series contain one big audio track
which you need to rip (see the section on using compressed audio files)
and copy into the game directory if you want to have in-game music
without the CD in the drive all the time. The speech is also in that
track and its volume is therefore changed with the music volume control
as well.

### 3.12) Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb notes

In order to run the Mac OS X Wyrmkeep re-release of the game you will
need to copy over data from the CD to your hard disk. If you're on a PC
then consult:

<https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Mac_Games>

Although it primarily talks about SCUMM games, it mentions the
"HFSExplorer" utility which you need to extract the files. Note that you
have to put the speech data "Inherit the Earth Voices" in the same
directory as the game data which is stored in:

Inherit the Earth.app/Contents/Resources

For the old Mac OS 9 release you need to copy the files in MacBinary
format, as they should include both resource and data forks. Copy all
'ITE \*' files.

### 3.13) Mickey's Space Adventure notes

To run Mickey's Space Adventure under ScummVM, the original executable
of the game (mickey.exe) is needed together with the game's data files.

There is extensive mouse support for the game under ScummVM, even though
there wasn't any mouse support in the original game. Menu items can be
selected using the mouse, and it is possible to move to other locations
using the mouse as well. When the mouse cursor is hovered on the edges
of the screen, it changes color to red if it is possible to walk towards
that direction. The player can then simply click on the edges of the
game's screen to change location, similar to many adventure games, which
is simpler and more straightforward than moving around using the menu.

### 3.14) Might and Magic Xeen games notes

To properly play the World of Xeen CD Talkie using original discs, use
LAME or some other encoder to rip the cd audio tracks to files, either
mp3 or ogg. Whichever you choose, the tracks of the first CD should be
named from track02 to track31, whereas the second CD's audio tracks
should be encoded and renamed as track32 through to track60.

For the GOG Might and Magic 4-5 installation, install the game to your
computer, and do the following steps:

  - The game1.inst (CUE) and game1.gog (BIN) file from the game folder
    is a CD image. Use software like Virtual CloneDrive to mount it as a
    drive. Linux and MacOS users can use bchunk to convert it to an ISO.
  - Copy all the .cc files from the subfolder in the mounted drive to a
    new empty game folder that you create for the game.
  - Copy all the music/\*.ogg files from the GOG installation to your
    game folder. You'll then need to rename all of them from xeen??.ogg
    to track??.ogg
  - You should then be able to point ScummVM to this new game folder,
    and the CD talkie version should be detected.

Savegames from either Clouds or Darkside of Xeen games can be
transferred across to World of Xeen (that combines both games) simply by
setting up and detecting World of Xeen (either by manually combining the
two games or using the GOG World of Xeen installer), and then renaming
the savegames to use the World of Xeen savegame format, by default
'worldofxeen.\*'

The Xeen engine also offers two custom options in the Engine tab for the
games in the ScummVM launcher. They are:

  - To change the threshold armor breaks at for characters from -10HP to
    -80HP
  - To show values for inventory items, even outside of the blacksmith,
    allowing the relative strength/value of armor and weapons to be
    compared.

### 3.15) Myst game notes

Left Click: Move/action
Space: Pause the game
Esc: Skip cutscene
F5: Menu

Myst will autosave to slot 0 if no save or an autosave is present in
slot 0.

### 3.16) Quest for Glory notes

It is possible to import characters, beginning with Quest for Glory II,
from past games to future games and continue from the stats earned from
those games.

For example, a character can be imported from Quest for Glory I directly
to Quest for Glory III without having to necessarily play Quest for
Glory II.

Characters cannot be imported from future games to past games, nor can a
character be imported to the same game that was just completed. In other
words, a character from Quest for Glory II cannot be imported into Quest
for Glory II.

If you want to use a saved character from the original Sierra
interpreter, you will need to rename the character file to
"qfg\[game-number\]-\[character-filename\].sav" and place it in the
ScummVM save path (see section 6.0), otherwise the file won't get listed
on the import screen.

Example: qfg2-thief.sav

### 3.17) Riven game notes

Left Click: Move/action
Arrow Keys: Movement
Page Up: Look up
Page Down: Look down
Space: Pause the game
Esc: Skip cutscene
F5: Menu
Ctrl-o: Load game
Ctrl-s: Save game

Riven will autosave to slot 0 if no save or an autosave is present in
slot 0.

### 3.18) Simon the Sorcerer games notes

If you have the dual version of Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2 on CD, you
will find the Windows version in the main directory of the CD and the
DOS version in the DOS directory of the CD.

### 3.19) Starship Titanic game notes

For the purposes of solving the starfield puzzle, only mouse clicks, L
and Tab are really needed, though the action glyph in the PET can be
used instead of Tab.

### 3.20) The Curse of Monkey Island notes

For this game, you will need the comi.la0, comi.la1 and comi.la2 files.
The comi.la0 file can be found on either CD, but since they are
identical it doesn't matter which one of them you use.

In addition, you will need to create a "resource" subdirectory
containing all of the files from -both- "resource" subdirectories on the
two CDs. Some of the files appear on both CDs, but again they're
identical.

### 3.21) The Feeble Files notes

Amiga/Macintosh: You need to install a small pack of cutscenes that are
missing in both of these versions of The Feeble Files. It's called "The
Feeble Files - Omni TV and epilogue cutscenes for the Amiga and
Macintosh versions" and you can get it here:

<https://www.scummvm.org/games/#feeble>

Windows: If you have the Windows version of The Feeble Files, there are
several things to note.

Many of the files necessary for the game are stored in an InstallShield
file called data1.cab, which ScummVM is unable to unpack. You will need
to use the original installer or i5comp to unpack the contents of this
file. The i5comp decompression tool, can be found via a search on the
internet.

To use the speech files with ScummVM, they need to be renamed as
follows:

  - Rename voices.wav on CD1 to voices1.wav
  - Rename voices.wav on CD2 to voices2.wav
  - Rename voices.wav on CD3 to voices3.wav
  - Rename voices.wav on CD4 to voices4.wav

### 3.22) The Legend of Kyrandia notes

To run The Legend of Kyrandia under ScummVM you need the `kyra.dat`
file. The file should already be included in official ScummVM packages.
In case ScummVM complains that the file is missing you can find it on
the `Downloads` page of the ScummVM website. Note that the current
Windows release of ScummVM should contain the file embedded into the
executable, thus you only need to grab it in case ScummVM complains
about the file being missing.

### 3.23) Troll's Tale notes

The original game came in a PC booter disk, therefore it is necessary to
dump the contents of that disk in an image file and name it "troll.img"
to be able to play the game under ScummVM.

### 3.24) Winnie the Pooh notes

It is possible to import saved games from the original interpreter of
the game into ScummVM.

There is extensive mouse support for the game under ScummVM, even though
there wasn't any mouse support in the original game. Menu items can be
selected using the mouse, and it is possible to move to other locations
using the mouse as well. When the mouse cursor is hovered on the edges
of the screen, it changes color to red if it is possible to walk towards
that direction. The player can then simply click on the edges of the
game's screen to change location, similar to many adventure games, which
is simpler and more straightforward than moving around using the menu.

### 3.25) Sierra AGI games: Predictive Input Dialog

The Predictive Input Dialog is a ScummVM aid for running AGI engine
games (which notoriously require command line input) on devices with
limited keyboard support. In these situations, since typing with
emulated keyboards is quite tedious, commands can be entered quickly and
easily via the Predictive Input Dialog.

In order to enable predictive input in AGI games, you need to copy the
pred.dic file in the ScummVM extras directory or the directory of the
game you wish to play. This dictionary has been created by parsing
through all known AGI games and contains the maximum set of common
words.

If the dictionary is detected, the Predictive Input Dialog is displayed
either when you click on the command line area (wherever keyboard input
is required, even in dialog boxes), or in some ports by pressing a
designated hot key.

The predictive input dialog operates in three modes, switchable by the
(\*)Pre/123/Abc button. The primary input method is the predictive mode
(Pre) which resembles the way "fast typing" is performed at phones. The
alphabet is divided into 9 sets which naturally map to the 9 number keys
of the numeric keypad (0 is space). To type in a word, you press once
the number of the set which contains the letter of the word you intend
to type, then move on to the next. For example, to type the command
`look`, you should press 5665. As you gradually type the intended word's
numeric code, the dictionary is accessed for known words matching your
input up to that point. As you press more keys, the prediction converges
to the correct word. This is why the printed word may change
dramatically between key presses. There exist situations though where
more than one words share the same numeric representation. For example
the words `quit` and `suit` map to the same number, namely 7848. In
these cases the (\#)next button lights up. By pressing it, you can cycle
through the list of words sharing the same code and finally accept the
correct one by pressing (0)space or the Ok button.

The second input method (123) is the numeric input: Each key you press
is entered verbatim as a number.

The third input method (Abc) is the Multi-tap Alpha input mode. This
mode is intended for entering free text, without assistance from the
dictionary scheme of predictive (Pre) mode. The text is entered one
letter at the time. For each letter first press the number of the set
which contains the letter you want, then use the (\#)next button to
cycle through the letters and repeat with another number. For example,
to enter the word `look` you must press the following:
5\#\#6\#\#6\#\#5\#

The dialog is fully usable with the mouse, but a few provisions have
been made in some ScummVM ports to make its use more comfortable by
naturally mapping the functionality to the numeric keypad. Also, the
dialog's buttons can be navigated with the arrow and the enter keys.

### 3.26) Sierra SCI games: Simultaneous speech and subtitles

Certain CD versions of Sierra SCI games had both speech and text
resources. Some have an option to toggle between the two, but there are
some cases where there wasn't any option to enable both simultaneously.
In ScummVM, it is possible to enjoy a combined mode, where both speech
and text are shown at the same time. This mode can be toggled in the
ScummVM audio options, but each game has different behavior in-game
regarding speech and text toggling.

The CD games where speech and subtitles can be shown simultaneously are:

  - EcoQuest 1 CD
  - Freddy Pharkas CD
  - Gabriel Knight CD
  - King's Quest 6 CD
  - King's Quest VII CD
  - Laura Bow 2 CD
  - Leisure Suit Larry 6 CD
  - Leisure Suit Larry 6 (hires) CD
  - Police Quest 4 CD
  - Shivers CD
  - Space Quest 4 CD
  - Space Quest 6 CD
  - Torin's Passage CD

**EcoQuest 1 CD:** Speech and text can be toggled via the game's "Mode"
option in the options dialog, or via ScummVM's audio options.

### 3.27) Zork games notes

To run the supported Zork games (Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands and
Zork: Grand Inquisitor) you need to copy some (extra) data to its
corresponding destination.

#### 3.27.1) Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands

Download the Liberation(tm) fonts package
<https://releases.pagure.org/liberation-fonts/liberation-fonts-ttf-2.00.1.tar.gz>
and unpack all the ttf files into your ScummVM extras directory.
Alternatively, ScummVM comes with the GNU FreeFont fonts, though at the
time of writing these fonts cause some text rendering issues. Download
the subtitles patch <https://www.thezorklibrary.com/installguides/znpatch.zip>
and unzip the addon directory into the game root directory

#### 3.27.2) Zork: Grand Inquisitor

Download the Liberation(tm) fonts package
<https://releases.pagure.org/liberation-fonts/liberation-fonts-ttf-2.00.1.tar.gz>
and unpack all the ttf files into your ScummVM extras directory.
Alternatively, ScummVM comes with the GNU FreeFont fonts, though at the
time of writing these fonts cause some text rendering issues.

### 3.28) Commodore64 games notes

Both Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken run but Maniac Mansion is not yet
playable. Simply name the D64 disks "maniac1.d64" and "maniac2.d64"
respectively "zak1.d64" and "zak2.d64", then ScummVM should be able to
automatically detect the game if you point it at the right directory.

Alternatively, you can use `extract_mm_c64` from the tools package to
extract the data files. But then the game will not be properly
autodetected by ScummVM, and you must make sure that the platform is set
to Commodore64. We recommend using the much simpler approach described
in the previous paragraph.

### 3.29) Macintosh games notes

All LucasArts SCUMM based adventures, except COMI, also exist in
versions for the Macintosh. ScummVM can use most (all?) of them,
however, in some cases some additional work is required. First off, if
you are not using a Macintosh for this, accessing the CD/floppy data
might be tricky. The reason for this is that the mac uses a special disk
format called HFS which other systems usually do not support. However,
there are various free tools which allow reading such HFS volumes. For
example `HFSExplorer` for Windows and `hfsutils` for Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems.

Most of the newer games on the Macintosh shipped with only a single data
file (note that in some cases this data file was made invisible, so you
may need extra tools in order to copy it). ScummVM is able to directly
use such a data file; simply point ScummVM at the directory containing
it, and it should work (just like with every other supported game).

We also provide a tool called `extract_scumm_mac` in the tools package
to extract the data from these data files, but this is neither required
nor recommended.

For further information on copying Macintosh game files to your hard
disk see:

<https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Mac_Games>

Xbox, and Xbox 360. Please note that these are not made
by us, so we neither endorse nor can we support them. Use at your own
risk\!

## 5.0) Running ScummVM

Please note that by default, ScummVM will save games in the directory it
is executed from, so you should refrain from running it from more than
one location. Further information, including how to specify a specific
save directory to avoid this issue, are in section 6.0.

ScummVM can be launched directly by running the executable. In this
case, the built-in launcher will activate. From this, you can add games
(click 'Add Game'), or launch games which have already been configured.
Games can also be added in mass quantities. By pressing shift + 'Add
Game' (Note that the image turns to 'Mass Add'), you can then specify a
directory to start in, and ScummVM will attempt to detect games in all
subdirectories of that directory.

ScummVM can also be launched into a game directly using Command Line
arguments -- see the next section.

### 5.1) Command Line Options

                              (default: 100)

The meaning of most long options (that is, those options starting with a
double-dash) can be inverted by prefixing them with "no-". For example,
`--no-aspect-ratio` will turn aspect ratio correction off. This is
useful if you want to override a setting in the configuration file.

The short game name ('game target') you see at the end of the command
line specifies which game is started. It either corresponds to an
arbitrary user defined target (from the configuration file), or to a
built-in gameid. A brief list of the latter can be found in section 3.0.

Examples:

  - Win32:
    Running Monkey Island, fullscreen, from a hard disk:
    `C:\Games\LucasArts\scummvm.exe -f -pC:\Games\LucasArts\monkey\
    scumm:monkey`
    Running Full Throttle from CD, fullscreen and with subtitles
    enabled:
    `C:\Games\LucasArts\scummvm.exe -f -n -pD:\resource\ scumm:ft`

  - Unix:
    Running Monkey Island, fullscreen, from a hard disk:
    `/path/to/scummvm -f -p/games/LucasArts/monkey/ scumm:monkey`
    Running Full Throttle from CD, fullscreen and with subtitles
    enabled:
    `/path/to/scummvm -f -n -p/cdrom/resource/ scumm:ft`

### 5.2) Global Menu

The Global Menu is a general menu which is available to all of the game
engines by pressing Ctrl-F5. From this menu there are the following
buttons: Resume, Options, About, Return to Launcher, and Quit. Selecting
`Options` will display a dialog where basic audio settings, such as
volume levels, can be adjusted. Selecting 'Return to Launcher' will
close the current game and return the user back to the ScummVM Launcher,
where another game may be selected to play.

Note: Returning to the Launcher is not supported by all of the engines,
and the button will be disabled in the Global Menu if it is not
supported.

Engines which currently support returning to the Launcher are:

    AGI
    AGOS
    BLADERUNNER
    CINE
    COMPOSER
    CRUISE
    CRYOMNI3D
    DRACI
    DRASCULA

    GROOVIE
    HUGO
    KYRA
    LURE
    MADE
    MOHAWK
    PARALLACTION
    QUEEN
    SAGA
    SCI
    SCUMM
    SKY
    SWORD1
    SWORD2
    TEENAGENT
    TITANIC
    TOUCHE
    TSAGE
    TUCKER
    ZVISION

### 5.3) Graphics filters

ScummVM offers several anti-aliasing filters to attempt to improve
visual quality. These are the same filters used in many other emulators,
such as MAME. These filters take the original game graphics, and scale
it by a certain fixed factor (usually 2x or 3x) before displaying them
to you. So for example, if the game originally run at a resolution of
320x200 (typical for most of the SCUMM games), then using a filter with
scale factor 2x will effectively yield 640x400 graphics. Likewise with a
3x filter you will get 960x600.

They are:

    1x         - No filtering, no scaling. Fastest.
    2x         - No filtering, factor 2x (default for non 640x480 games).
    3x         - No filtering, factor 3x.
    2xsai      - 2xSAI filter, factor 2x.
    super2xsai - Enhanced 2xSAI filtering, factor 2x.
    supereagle - Less blurry than 2xSAI, but slower. Factor 2x.
    advmame2x  - Doesn't rely on blurring like 2xSAI, fast. Factor 2x.
    advmame3x  - Doesn't rely on blurring like 2xSAI, fast. Factor 3x.
    hq2x       - Very nice high quality filter but slow. Factor 2x.
    hq3x       - Very nice high quality filter but slow. Factor 3x.
    tv2x       - Interlace filter, tries to emulate a TV. Factor 2x.
    dotmatrix  - Dot matrix effect. Factor 2x.

To select a graphics filter, select it in the Launcher, or pass its name
via the '-g' option to scummvm, for example:

    scummvm -gadvmame2x scumm:monkey2

Note \#1: Not all backends support all (or even any) of the filters
listed above; some may support additional ones. The filters listed above
are those supported by the default SDL backend.

Note \#2: Filters can be very slow when ScummVM is compiled in a debug
configuration without optimizations. And there is always a speed impact
when using any form of anti-aliasing/linear filtering.

Note \#3: The FM-TOWNS version of Zak McKracken uses an original
resolution of 320x240, hence for this game scalers will scale to 640x480
or 960x720. Likewise, games that originally were using 640x480 (such as
Curse of Monkey Island or Broken Sword) will be scaled to 1280x960 and
1920x1440.

### 5.4) Hotkeys

ScummVM supports various in-game hotkeys. They differ between SCUMM
games and other games.

```
  Common:
    Ctrl-F5                - Displays the Global Menu
    Cmd-q                  - Quit (Mac OS X)
    Ctrl-q                 - Quit (other unices including Linux)
    Alt-F4                 - Quit (Windows)
    Ctrl-z                 - Quit (other platforms)
    Ctrl-u                 - Mute all sounds
    Ctrl-m                 - Toggle mouse capture
    Ctrl-Alt 1-8           - Switch between graphics filters
    Ctrl-Alt + and -       - Increase/Decrease the scale factor
    Ctrl-Alt a             - Toggle aspect-ratio correction on/off
                             Most of the games use a 320x200 pixel
                             resolution, which may look squashed on
                             modern monitors. Aspect-ratio correction
                             stretches the image to use 320x240 pixels
                             instead, or a multiple thereof
    Ctrl-Alt f             - Enable/disable graphics filtering
    Ctrl-Alt s             - Cycle through scaling modes
    Alt-Enter              - Toggles full screen/windowed

synchronisation.

### 5.5) Language options

ScummVM includes a language option for Maniac Mansion, Zak McKracken,
The Dig, The Curse of Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel Sky and Broken
Sword.

Note that with the exception of Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword,
multilanguage versions of Goblins games and Nippon Safes Inc., using
this option does *not* change the language of the game (which usually is
hardcoded), but rather is only used to select the appropriate font (e.g.
for a German version of a game, one containing umlauts).

An exception are The Dig and The Curse of Monkey Island -- non-English
versions can be set to 'English.' This however only affects subtitles;
game speech will remain the same.

    Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken

## 6.0) Saved Games

Saved games are by default put in the current directory on some
platforms and preset directories on others. You can specify the save in
the config file by setting the savepath parameter. See the example
config file later in this README.

The platforms that currently have a different default directory are:

**Mac OS X:**

`$HOME/Documents/ScummVM Savegames/`

**Other unices:**

We follow the XDG Base Directory Specification. This means by default
saved games can be found in: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/scummvm/saves/`

If `XDG_DATA_HOME` is not defined or empty, `~/.local/share` will be
used as value of `XDG_DATA_HOME` in accordance with the specification.

If an earlier version of ScummVM was installed on your system, the
previous default location of `~/.scummvm` will be kept. This is detected
based on the presence of the path `~/.scummvm`.

**Windows Vista/7:**

`\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\ScummVM\Saved games\`

**Windows 2000/XP:**

`\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\ScummVM\Saved games\`

**Windows NT4:**

`<windir>\Profiles\username\Application Data\ScummVM\Saved games\`

Saved games are stored under a hidden area in Windows
NT4/2000/XP/Vista/7, which can be accessed by running
`%APPDATA%\ScummVM\Saved Games` or by enabling hidden files in Windows
Explorer.

Note for Windows NT4/2000/XP/Vista/7 users: The default saved games
location changed in ScummVM 1.5.0. The migration batch file can be used
to copy saved games from the old default location, to the new default
location.

### 6.1) Autosaves

For some games ScummVM will by default automatically save the current
state every five minutes (adjustable via the `autosave_period` config
setting). The default autosave slot for many engines is slot 0.

The games/engines listed below have autosave support.

  - AGI games
  - Beneath a Steel Sky
  - Bud Tucker in Double Trouble
  - COMPOSER games
  - Flight of the Amazon Queen
  - Myst
  - Riven
  - SCUMM games
  - The Legend of Kyrandia I (slot 999)
  - ZVISION games

For the SCUMM engine, this saved game can then be loaded again via
Ctrl-0, or the F5 menu.

### 6.2) Converting Saved Games

Using saved games from original versions isn't supported by all game
engines. Only the following games can use saved games from their
original versions.

  - Blade Runner

      - Use the debugger console and command "save" to save the game to
        the original format and command "load" to load such a one
      - Saved games between different languages are interchangeable
      - It is not recommended to convert saved games from the version
        with restored content as they might behave unexpectedly
        or might cause game breaking bugs

  - Elvira 1

      - Add 8 bytes (saved game name) to the start of the saved game
        file
      - Rename the saved game to `elvira1.xxx`

  - Elvira 2

      - Add 8 bytes (saved game name) to the start of the saved game
        file
      - Rename the saved game to `elvira2-pc.xxx` (DOS version) or
        `elvira2.xxx` (Other versions)

  - Myst

      - Rename the saved game to `myst-xxx.mys`
      - Saves from the masterpiece edition and the regular edition are
        interchangeable

  - Riven

      - Rename the saved game to `riven-xxx.rvn`
      - Saves from the CD and DVD edition are not interchangeable

  - Simon the Sorcerer 1

      - Rename the saved game to `simon1.xxx`

  - Simon the Sorcerer 2

      - Rename the saved game to `simon2.xxx`

  - Starship Titanic

      - Rename the saved game to `titanic-win.xxx` for saves from the
        English version and `titanic-win-de.xxx` for saves from the
        German version
      - Saved games between different languages are not interchangeable

  - The Feeble Files

      - Rename the saved game to `feeble.xxx`

  - Waxworks

      - Add 8 bytes (saved game name) to the start of the saved game
        file
      - Rename the saved game to `waxworks-pc.xxx` (DOS version) or
        `waxworks.xxx` (Other versions)

Where `xxx` is exact the saved game slot (i.e., 001) under ScummVM

### 6.3) Viewing/Loading saved games from the command line

**`--list-saves`**

This switch may be used to display a list of the current saved games of
the specified target game and their corresponding save slots. If no
target is specified, it lists saved games for all known target.

Usage: `--list-saves --game=[TARGET]`, where \[TARGET\] is the target
game.

Engines which currently support `--list-saves` are:

  - AGI
  - AGOS
  - BLADERUNNER
  - CGE
  - CINE
  - CRUISE
  - CRYOMNI3D
  - DRACI
  - GROOVIE
  - HUGO

  - SWORD2
  - TEENAGENT
  - TINSEL
  - TITANIC
  - TOON
  - TOUCHE

  - TUCKER
  - ZVISION

**`--save-slot/-x`**

This switch may be used to load a saved game directly from the command
line.

Usage: `--save-slot[SLOT]` or `-x[SLOT]`, where \[SLOT\] is the save
slot number.

Engines which currently support `--save-slot` / `-x are`:

  - AGI

## 7.0) Music and Sound

On most operating systems and for most games, ScummVM will by default
use MT-32 or AdLib emulation for music playback. MIDI may not be
available on all operating systems or may need manual configuration. If
you want to use MIDI, you have several different choices of output,
depending on your operating system and configuration.

    null       - Null output. Don't play any music.

    adlib      - Internal AdLib emulation
    fluidsynth - FluidSynth MIDI emulation
    mt32       - Internal MT-32 emulation
    pcjr       - Internal PCjr emulation (only usable in SCUMM games)
    pcspk      - Internal PC Speaker emulation
    towns      - Internal FM-TOWNS YM2612 emulation
                 (only usable in SCUMM FM-TOWNS games)

    alsa       - Output using ALSA sequencer device. See below.
    core       - CoreAudio sound, for Mac OS X users.
    coremidi   - CoreMIDI sound, for Mac OS X users. Use only if you have
                 a hardware MIDI synthesizer.
    seq        - Use /dev/sequencer for MIDI, *nix users. See below.
    timidity   - Connect to TiMidity++ MIDI server. See below.
    windows    - Windows MIDI. Uses built-in sequencer, for Windows users

To select a sound driver, select it in the Launcher, or pass its name
via the `-e` option to scummvm, for example:

`scummvm -eadlib scumm:monkey2`

### 7.1) AdLib emulation

By default an AdLib card will be emulated and ScummVM will output the
music as sampled waves. This is the default mode for several games, and
offers the best compatibility between machines and games.

### 7.2) FluidSynth MIDI emulation

If ScummVM was build with libfluidsynth support it will be able to play
MIDI music through the FluidSynth driver. You will have to specify a
SoundFont to use, however.

Since the default output volume from FluidSynth can be fairly low,
ScummVM will set the gain by default to get a stronger signal. This can
be further adjusted using the `--midi-gain` command-line option, or the
`midi_gain` config file setting.

The setting can take any value from 0 through 1000, with the default
being 100. (This corresponds to FluidSynth's gain settings of 0.0
through 10.0, which are presumably measured in decibel.)

NOTE: The processor requirements for FluidSynth can be fairly high in
some cases. A fast CPU is recommended.

### 7.3) MT-32 emulation

Some games which contain MIDI music data also have improved tracks
designed for the MT-32 sound module. ScummVM can now emulate this
device, however you must provide original MT-32 ROMs to make it work:

`MT32_PCM.ROM` - IC21 (512KB)
`MT32_CONTROL.ROM` - IC26 (32KB) and IC27 (32KB), interleaved byte-wise

Place these ROMs in the game directory, in your extrapath, or in the
directory where your ScummVM executable resides.

You don't need to specify `--native-mt32` with this driver, as it
automatically gets turned on.

NOTE: The processor requirements for the emulator are quite high; a fast
CPU is strongly recommended.

### 7.4) MIDI emulation

Some games (such as Sam & Max) only contain MIDI music data. This once
prevented music for these games from working on platforms that do not
support MIDI, or soundcards that do not provide MIDI drivers (e.g. many
soundcards will not play MIDI under Linux). ScummVM can now emulate MIDI
mode using sampled waves and AdLib, FluidSynth MIDI emulation or MT-32
emulation using the `-eadlib`, `-efluidsynth` or `-emt32` options
respectively. However, if you are capable of using native MIDI, we
recommend using one of the MIDI modes below for best sound.

### 7.5) Native MIDI support

Use the appropriate `-e<mode>` command line option from the list above
to select your preferred MIDI device. For example, if you wish to use
the Windows MIDI driver, use the `-ewindows` option.

#### 7.5.1) Using MIDI options to customize Native MIDI output

ScummVM supports a variety of MIDI modes, depending on the capabilities
of your MIDI device.

If `--native-mt32` is specified, ScummVM will treat your device as a
real MT-32. Because the instrument mappings and system exclusive
commands of the MT-32 vary from those of General MIDI devices, you
should only enable this option if you are using an actual Roland MT-32,
LAPC-I, CM-64, CM-32L, CM-500, or GS device with an MT-32 map.

If `--enable-gs` is specified, ScummVM will initialize your
GS-compatible device with settings that mimic the MT-32's reverb, (lack
of) chorus, pitch bend sensitivity, etc. If it is specified in
conjunction with `--native-mt32`, ScummVM will select the
MT-32-compatible map and drumset on your GS device. This setting works
better than default GM or GS emulation with games that do not have
custom instrument mappings (Loom and Monkey1). You should only specify
both settings if you are using a GS device that has an MT-32 map, such
as an SC-55, SC-88, SC-88 Pro, SC-8820, SC-8850, etc. Please note that
`--enable-gs` is automatically disabled in both DOTT and Samnmax, since
they use General MIDI natively.

If neither of the above settings is enabled, ScummVM will initialize
your device in General MIDI mode and use GM emulation in games with
MT-32 soundtracks.

Some games contain sound effects that are exclusive to the AdLib
soundtrack. For these games, you may wish to specify `--multi-midi` in
order to combine MIDI music with AdLib sound effects.

### 7.6) UNIX native, ALSA and dmedia sequencer support

If your soundcard driver supports a sequencer, you may set the
environment variable `SCUMMVM_MIDI` to your sequencer device -- for
example, to /dev/sequencer

If you have problems with not hearing audio in this configuration, you
may need to set the environment variable `SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT` to 1 or 2.
This selects the port on the selected sequencer to use. Then start
scummvm with the `-eseq` parameter. This should work on several cards,
and may offer better performance and quality than AdLib emulation.
However, for those systems where sequencer support does not work, you
can always fall back on AdLib emulation.

#### 7.6.1) ALSA sequencer \[UNIX ONLY\]

If you have installed the ALSA driver with sequencer support, then you
may set the environment variable `SCUMMVM_PORT` or the config file
variable `alsa_port` to specify your sequencer port. If neither is set,
the default behavior is to try both "65:0" and "17:0".

Here is a brief guide on how to use the ALSA sequencer with your
soundcard. In all cases, to obtain a list of all the sequencer ports you
have, try the command `aconnect -o -l`. This should give output similar
to:

```
    client 14: 'Midi Through' [type=kernel]
        0 'Midi Through Port-0'
    client 16: 'SBLive! Value [CT4832]' [type=kernel]
        0 'EMU10K1 MPU-401 (UART)'
    client 17: 'Emu10k1 WaveTable' [type=kernel]
        0 'Emu10k1 Port 0  '
        1 'Emu10k1 Port 1  '
        2 'Emu10k1 Port 2  '
        3 'Emu10k1 Port 3  '
    client 128: 'TiMidity' [type=user]
        0 'TiMidity port 0 '
        1 'TiMidity port 1 '
        2 'TiMidity port 2 '
        3 'TiMidity port 3 '
```

The most important bit here is that there are four WaveTable MIDI
outputs located at 17:0, 17:1, 17:2 and 17:3, and four TiMidity ports
located at 128:0, 128:1, 128:2 and 128:3.

If you have a FM-chip on your card, like the SB16, then you have to load
the SoundFonts using the sbiload software. Example:

    sbiload -p 17:0 /etc/std.o3 /etc/drums.o3

If you have a WaveTable capable sound card, you have to load a sbk or
sf2 SoundFont using the sfxload or asfxload software. Example:

    sfxload /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2

If you don't have a MIDI capable soundcard, there are two options:
FluidSynth and TiMidity. We recommend FluidSynth, as on many systems
TiMidity will 'lag' behind music. This is very noticeable in
iMUSE-enabled games, which use fast and dynamic music transitions.
Running TiMidity as root will allow it to setup real time priority,
which may reduce music lag.

Asking TiMidity to become an ALSA sequencer:

    timidity -iAqqq -B2,8 -Os1S -s 44100 &

(If you get distorted output with this setting, you can try dropping the
-B2,8 or changing the value.)

Asking FluidSynth to become an ALSA sequencer (using SoundFonts):

    fluidsynth -m alsa_seq /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2

Once either TiMidity or FluidSynth are running, use the 'aconnect -o -l'
command as described earlier in this section.

#### 7.6.2) IRIX dmedia sequencer: \[UNIX ONLY\]

If you are using IRIX and the dmedia driver with sequencer support, you
can set the environment variable `SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT` or the config file
variable `dmedia_port` to specify your sequencer port. The default is to
use the first port.

To get a list of configured midi interfaces on your system, run
"startmidi" without parameters. Example output:

```
  2 MIDI interfaces configured:
          Serial Port 2
          Software Synth
```

In this example, you can configure ScummVM to use the "Software Synth"
instead of the default "Serial Port 2" by adding a line

    dmedia_port=Software Synth

to your configuration file in the section \[scummvm\], or setting
`SCUMMVM_PORT=Software Synth` in your environment.

### 7.7) TiMidity++ MIDI server support

If your system lacks any MIDI sequencer, but you still want better MIDI
quality than default AdLib emulation can offer, you can try the
TiMidity++ MIDI server. See <http://timidity.sourceforge.net/> for
download and install instructions.

First, you need to start a daemon:

    timidity -ir 7777

Now you can start ScummVM and try selection TiMidity music output. By
default, it will connect to localhost:7777, but you can change host/port
via the `TIMIDITY_HOST` environment variable. You can also specify a
"device number" using the `SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT` environment variable.

### 7.8) Using compressed audio files

#### 7.8.1) Using MP3 files for CD audio

Use LAME or some other MP3 encoder to rip the cd audio tracks to files.
Name the files track1.mp3 track2.mp3 etc. ScummVM must be compiled with
MAD support to use this option. You will need to rip the file from the
CD as a WAV file, then encode the MP3 files in constant bit rate. This
can be done with the following LAME command line:

    lame -t -q 0 -b 96 track1.wav track1.mp3

#### 7.8.2) Using Ogg Vorbis files for CD audio

Use oggenc or some other vorbis encoder to encode the audio tracks to
files. Name the files track1.ogg track2.ogg etc. ScummVM must be
compiled with vorbis support to use this option. You will need to rip
the files from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the vorbis files. This
can be done with the following oggenc command line with the value after
q specifying the desired quality from 0 to 10:

    oggenc -q 5 track1.wav

#### 7.8.3) Using Flac files for CD audio

Use flac or some other flac encoder to encode the audio tracks to files.
Name the files track1.flac track2.flac etc. If your filesystem only
allows three letter extensions, name the files track1.fla track2.fla
etc. ScummVM must be compiled with flac support to use this option. You
will need to rip the files from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the
flac files. This can be done with the following flac command line:

    flac --best track1.wav

Remember that the quality is always the same, varying encoder options
will only affect the encoding time and resulting filesize.

#### 7.8.4) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with MP3

You need LAME, and our `compress_scumm_sou` utility from the
scummvm-tools package to perform this task, and ScummVM must be compiled
with MAD support.

    compress_scumm_sou monster.sou

Eventually you will have a much smaller monster.so3 file, copy this file
to your game directory. You can safely remove the monster.sou file.

#### 7.8.5) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Ogg Vorbis

As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with OGG support. Run:

    compress_scumm_sou --vorbis monster.sou

This should produce a smaller monster.sog file, which you should copy to
your game directory. Ogg encoding may take a considerable longer amount
of time than MP3, so have a good book handy.

#### 7.8.6) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Flac

As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with Flac support. Run:

    compress_scumm_sou --flac monster.sou

This should produce a smaller monster.sof file, which you should copy to
your game directory. Remember that the quality is always the same,
varying encoder options will only affect the encoding time and resulting
file size. Playing with the blocksize (`-b <value>`), has the biggest
impact on the resulting file size -- 1152 seems to be a good value for
those kind of soundfiles. Be sure to read the encoder documentation
before you use other values.

#### 7.8.7) Compressing music/sfx/speech in AGOS games

Use our `compress_agos` utility from the scummvm-tools package to
perform this task. You can choose between multiple target formats, but
note that you can only use each if ScummVM was compiled with the
respective decoder support enabled.

```
  compress_agos effects     (For Acorn CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_agos simon       (For Acorn CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_agos effects.voc (For DOS CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_agos simon.voc   (For DOS CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_agos simon.wav   (For Windows CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_agos simon2.voc  (For DOS CD version of Simon 2)
  compress_agos simon2.wav  (For Windows CD version of Simon 2)
  compress_agos mac         (For Macintosh version of Simon 2)

  compress_agos voices1.wav (For Windows 2CD/4CD version of Feeble)
  compress_agos voices2.wav (For Windows 2CD/4CD version of Feeble)
  compress_agos voices3.wav (For Windows 4CD version of Feeble)
  compress_agos voices4.wav (For Windows 4CD version of Feeble)

  compress_agos Music       (For Windows version of Puzzle Pack)
```

For Ogg Vorbis add `--vorbis` to the options, i.e.

    compress_agos --vorbis

For Flac add `--flac` and optional parameters, i.e.

    compress_agos --flac

Eventually you will have a much smaller \*.mp3, \*.ogg or \*.fla file,
copy this file to your game directory. You can safely remove the old
file.

#### 7.8.8) Compressing speech/music in Broken Sword

The `compress_sword1` tool from the scummvm-tools package can encode
music and speech to MP3, Ogg Vorbis as well as Flac. The easiest way to
encode the files is simply copying the executable into your BS1
directory (together with the lame encoder) and run it from there. This
way, it will automatically encode everything to MP3. Afterwards, you can
manually remove the SPEECH?.CLU files and the wave music files.

Running `compress_sword1 --vorbis` will compress the files using Ogg
Vorbis instead of MP3.

Running `compress_sword1 --flac` will compress the files using Flac
instead of MP3.

Use `compress_sword1 --help` to get a full list of the options.

#### 7.8.9) Compressing speech/music in Broken Sword II

Use our `compress_sword2` utility from the scummvm-tools package to
perform this task. You can choose between multiple target formats, but
note that you can only use each if ScummVM was compiled with the
respective decoder support enabled.

```
  compress_sword2 speech1.clu
  compress_sword2 music1.clu
```

For Ogg Vorbis add --vorbis to the options, i.e.

    compress_sword2 --vorbis

Eventually you will have a much smaller \*.cl3 or \*.clg file, copy this
file to your game directory. You can safely remove the old file.

It is possible to use Flac compression by adding the `--flac` option.
However, the resulting \*.clf file will actually be larger than the
original.

Please note that `compress_sword2` will only work with the four
speech/music files in Broken Sword II. It will not work with any of the
other \*.clu files, nor will it work with the speech files from Broken
Sword.

### 7.9) Output sample rate

The output sample rate tells ScummVM how many sound samples to play per
channel per second. There is much that could be said on this subject,
but most of it would be irrelevant here. The short version is that for
most games 22050 Hz is fine, but in some cases 44100 Hz is preferable.
On extremely low-end systems you may want to use 11025 Hz, but it is
unlikely that you have to worry about that.

To elaborate, most of the sounds ScummVM has to play were sampled at
either 22050 Hz or 11025 Hz. Using a higher sample rate will not
magically improve the quality of these sounds. Hence, 22050 Hz is fine.

Some games use CD audio. If you use compressed files for this, they are
probably sampled at 44100 Hz, so for these games that may be a better
choice of sample rate.

When using the AdLib, FM Towns, PC Speaker or IBM PCjr music drivers,
ScummVM is responsible for generating the samples. Usually 22050 Hz will
be plenty for these, but there is at least one piece of AdLib music in
Beneath a Steel Sky that will sound a lot better at 44100 Hz.

Using frequencies in between is not recommended. For one thing, your
sound card may not support it. In theory, ScummVM should fall back on a
sensible frequency in that case, but don't count on it. More
importantly, ScummVM has to resample all sounds to its output frequency.
This is much easier to do well if the output frequency is a multiple of
the original frequency.

## 8.0) Configuration file

By default, the configuration file is saved in, and loaded from:

**Windows Vista/7:**

`\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\ScummVM\scummvm.ini`

**Windows 2000/XP:**

`\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\ScummVM\scummvm.ini`

**Windows NT4:**

`<windir>\Profiles\username\Application Data\ScummVM\scummvm.ini`

**Windows 95/98/ME:**

`<windir>\scummvm.ini`

If an earlier version of ScummVM was installed under Windows, the
previous default location of `<windir>\scummvm.ini` will be kept.

**Unix:**

We follow the XDG Base Directory Specification. This means our
configuration can be found in: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/scummvm/scummvm.ini`

If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not defined or empty, `~/.config` will be used
as value for `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` in accordance with the specification.

If an earlier version of ScummVM was installed on your system, the
previous default location of `~/.scummvmrc` will be kept.

**Mac OS X:**

`~/Library/Preferences/ScummVM Preferences` (here, `~` refers to your
home directory)

**iOS:**


For sandboxed version: `/Preferences`
Otherwise: `/var/mobile/Library/ScummVM/Preferences`

**Others:**

`scummvm.ini` in the current directory

An example config file looks as follows:

```
    [scummvm]
    gfx_mode=supereagle
    fullscreen=true
    savepath=C:\saves\

    [sky]

                                enhance GM emulation. If native_mt32 is also
                                true, the GS device will select an MT-32 map
                                to play the correct instruments.
    sfx_volume         number   The sfx volume setting (0-255)

                                Queen

    boot_param         number   Pass this number to the boot script

Sierra games using the AGI engine add the following non-standard keywords:

    originalsaveload   bool     If true, the original save/load screens are
                                used instead of the enhanced ScummVM ones
    altamigapalette    bool     Use an alternative palette, common for all
                                Amiga games. This was the old behavior
    mousesupport       bool     Enables mouse support. Allows to use mouse
                                for movement and in game menus

Sierra games using the SCI engine add the following non-standard keywords:

    disable_dithering  bool     Remove dithering artifacts from EGA games
    prefer_digitalsfx  bool     If true, digital sound effects are preferred
                                instead of synthesized ones
    originalsaveload   bool     If true, the original save/load screens are
                                used instead of the enhanced ScummVM ones
    native_fb01        bool     If true, the music driver for an IBM Music
                                Feature card or a Yamaha FB-01 FM synth module
                                is used for MIDI output

### 8.2) Custom game options that can be toggled via the GUI

A lot of the custom game options in the previous section can be toggled
via the GUI. If a custom option is available for a specific game, a new
tab called "Engine" will appear when adding or editing the configuration
of that game. If the custom options are not shown, the games in question
will need to be run once or readded in the ScummVM launcher's game list.
This will update the configuration of each entry, allowing the custom
options to be shown.

## 9.0) Screenshots (SDL backend only)

On systems using the SDL backend (for example Windows, Mac or Linux) you
can use alt+s to take snapshots (see section 5.4 - Hotkeys).

You can specify the directory in which you want the screenshots to be
created in the config file. To do so add a screenshotpath value under
the `[scummvm]` section:

    [scummvm]
    screenshotpath=/path/to/screenshots/

The default location, when no screenshot path is defined in the config
file, depends on the OS:

  - Windows: In `Users\username\My Pictures\ScummVM Screenshots`.
  - macOS X: On the Desktop.
  - Other unices: In the XDG Pictures user directory,
      e.g. `~/Pictures/ScummVM Screenshots`
  - Any other OS: In the current directory.

## 10.0) Compiling

For an up-to-date overview on how to compile ScummVM for various
platforms, please consult our Wiki, in particular this page:

<https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Compiling_ScummVM>

If you are compiling for Windows, Linux or Mac OS X, you need SDL-1.2.2
or newer (older versions may work, but are unsupported), and a supported
compiler. Several compilers, including GCC, mingw and recent versions of
Microsoft Visual C++ are supported. If you wish to use MP3-compressed CD
tracks or .SOU files, you will need to install the MAD library; likewise
you will need the appropriate libraries for Ogg Vorbis and FLAC
compressed sound. For compressed save states, zlib is required.

Some parts of ScummVM, particularly scalers, have highly optimized
versions written in assembler. If you wish to use this option, you will
need to install nasm assembler (see <https://www.nasm.us/>). Note that
we currently only have x86 MMX optimized versions, and they will not
compile on other processors.

On Windows, you can define `USE_WINDBG` and attach WinDbg to browse
debug messages (see
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/index>).
