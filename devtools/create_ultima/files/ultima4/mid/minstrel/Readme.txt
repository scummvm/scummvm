MIDI files (C) 1998 by Markus Brenner (Minstrel Dragon) -==(UDIC)==-

This archive originally consists of 9 .mid files and this readme file.
You can get the latest version of the zip-archive at

     http://www.biochem.mpg.de/~brenner/binary/u4-midi.zip

This is the original score of the Apple ][ Ultima IV soundtrack.
I tried to keep the right tempo and key of the individual songs,
as well as the general mood when picking the midi instruments.

I own a Roland SCB-7 General MIDI Sound Canvas (daughter board)
so the music is optimized for this device. I used panpot effect,
Effect 1 (Reverb depth) and Effect3 (Chorus depth).
If you use these files on another card please tell me if they
sound OK.
