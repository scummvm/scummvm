Many are the monsters and terrors that dwell beneath the surface or in the forests and marshes of Britannia. Even groups of most valiant and fierce warriors are subject to losses too tragic to bear. If a companion is slain by an enemy, all is not lost in the presence of the most accomplished of mages. There exists the means to bring back a compatriot from the land of the dead—not as an unholy once-dead being—but as a living, breathing creature of flesh and blood restores to life, albeit in an extremely weakened condition. Each wizard must determine the components of this enchantment that work best with their own magic, for the combination is said to be unique to each spellcaster. What is known about weaving this is the most potent of all enchantments is that it requires the spellcaster to scatter the reagents to cover the victim’s body, while calling out the name of the slain companion in a voice of thunder. This magic is extraordinarily taxing, and rare is the mage who can continue to weave spells without rest once this enchantment has been successfully cast.
