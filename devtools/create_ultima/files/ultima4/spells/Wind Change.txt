Wind Change
Not all Britannia is accessible on foot, and oft times the Wizard will find the need to embark on a sea voyage to reach some destinations in the pursuit of Truth. Once aboard ship, most voyagers find themselves at the mercy of capricious nature with her ever-changing wings. This is not true for the practitioner of the mystic arts, however, for through magical means one may control the very direction of the wind, albeit for but a short span of time.
  Wind change is not a taxing enchantment; indeed a powerful wizard can cast it almost continuously, although it is not so trivial as opening trapped chests or effecting minor teleportationsâ€¦ Simply mix Sulphurous Ash for power and Blood Moss for movement to coax the wind to a more favorable direction. Speak the name of the patron of winds and call out the direction desired and the wind shall change at your bidding.
