Sleep
There are moments in lives of every practitioner of the mystic arts where discretion is truly the better part of valor. Not all foes are truly evil and deserving of annihilation—verily, some are but beast of the field seeking provender and are entitled to life as much as you or I. Yet, unchecked these creatures pose as great a threat to one as a score of rabid orcs. It is in such situations that the wise thamaturge weaves a Sleep spell and leaves his opposition in deep slumber whilst vacating the current location. The Sleep spell is truly a serious enchantment that requires a fair amount of mental energy to cast, but it is not of such import as to leave the spellcaster breathless or exhausted. To send your foes to the land of slumber, mix a double portion of Spider Silk with some Ginseng and chant “Duerme” as you sprinkle the reagents into the air. Fear not the distance between you and the intended victims, for the binding power of the Spider Silk will enfold them from afar, while the healing Ginseng will gently wrap them in deep sleep.
