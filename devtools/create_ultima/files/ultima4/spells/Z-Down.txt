Z-Down
The “Z” or Down spell is perhaps the most simplest of all the teleportation spells. It requires the simplest of all teleportation spells. It requires the same components as the “Y” or Up spell—these being Blood Moss for movement and Spider Silk for its binding qualities—but requires half the mental energy and concentration on the part of the spellcaster due to the natural tendency of all bodies to move downward. The origin of the name is uncertain, but it is believed that the letter “Z” is the first letter of the unpronounceable Truename of the Lord of the Underworld, a demon of much power. To effect the spell, the spellcaster must scatter the reagents and chant “Baja” in stentorian tones. The lower the tonality of the chant, the higher the probability of the party moving down one level of a dungeon.
