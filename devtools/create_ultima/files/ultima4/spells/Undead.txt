Undead
Ever since the coming of the evil wizard Mondain and his hellish offspring, the lands of Britannia have been plagued by the return of creatures already slain. These once-dead begins take many forms, the most common being the animated skeletons of orcs and goblins, or the ghoulish forms of flesh-eating corpses that have been summoned from the land of shades to wreak havoc on the living. These apparitions are cowed by the light of righteousness and fight as warriors in a trance. Nonetheless, they are hard to kill and never tire in battle and thus may jeopardize even a seasoned band of adventurers. Each mage knows a form of turning them aside when encountered, but the components of such magics are personal and depend on the spellcaster. You must use your knowledge of the properties of magical reagents to determine which two will lend force to your enchantment of Undead turning. When you have found the proper mixture, cast it at your foes while chanting the name of what the creatures once were when they trod the earth in life.
