Protection
There are times during the hear of battle when one finds the best form of offense to be naught but a good defense. When hard-pressed by fierce antagonists, the wise magician will mix together the reagents Sulphurous Ash, ginseng, and Garlic and invoke the spell of Protection. The wholesome qualities of the Ginseng, together with repellent strength of the Garlic, serve to shield the wizard and all companions from the onslaught of their enemies. Such protection is not always effective, but may be of great use. Sulphurous ash provides the mystic fire that fuels the incantation, and also serves to startle one’s opponents with an initial flash as the spell begins to function. Protection is not a simple spell, but neither is it an exceptionally strenuous spell to cast. Its duration is short, and during the course of its shielding the mage will be reminded of its effects by glowing “P” hovering before his or her eyes.
