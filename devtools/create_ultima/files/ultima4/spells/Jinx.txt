Jinx
There are but two enchantments more powerful and difficult than the Jinx spell, and but one of similar potency. When faced with a closely packed horde of enemies, mix together equal quantities of Black Pearl, deadly Nightshade, and the crimson Mandrake Root to cast at your opponents. Call to their attention the vulnerability of their backs and weave the magic. They shall turn and smite each other as if each was alone in a crowd of mortal foes. The Black Pearl shall carry your spell to their very midst, while the hallucinatory might of the Nightshade will confound them beyond the boundaries of common sense. Mandrake Root lends the power of conviction to their misconceptions. The duration of the enchantment is varied, but throughout its course the spellcaster will be reminded of its potency by the presence of a glowing “J”. Be warned, however, that the casting of the Jinx spell requires a great exertion.
