There was once a time when all beings were fair and just. The principal vessel used for the transport of one’s worldly possessions in these times was the wooden chest, which is still the popular means. But since the coming of the evil ones and their lasting influence on the inhabitants of our fair land, the practice of placing obnoxious and sometimes lethal traps on the locks of chests has become quite commonplace. Virtually all folk use such devices, even the denizens of the underworld who guard naught but ill- gotten wealth. To bypass these sinister mechanisms the thaumaturge need but utter the chant “Appar Unem” and sprinkle a mix of Sulphurous Ash and Blood Moss on the offending lock. The flash of Sulphurous Ash powers the movement potential of the Blood Moss and the lock will open itself safely, leaving the contents of the chest at the disposal of the spellcaster.
