Heal
One of the cornerstones of the good and true path of the wizard is the use of enchantment for beneficial ends. We have discussed the Cure spell which renders venom as harmless as the purest of well water, but the most common form of injury is the physical wound rather than the internal disruption brought on by poison. Swords and talons do not discriminate and the tools of justice are oft used for unjust purposes. When you or your companions have suffered physical injury that hath rent of seared the flesh, the Heal spell is invaluable. Mix similar quantities of the healing essence of Ginseng with the integrating strength of Spider Silk and apply it to the wound. Speak the name of the victim and the flesh will be hastened along the road to wholeness.
