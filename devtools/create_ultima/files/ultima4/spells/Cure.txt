Cure
Venomous creatures abound throughout the lands of Britannia. Rarely are they evil, nature having provided them with their sting as a means of defense against larger predators, but without proper attention wounds can fester and lead to the death of a victim. Furthermore, evil mages may cast noxious, poisonous energy fields during battle or erect such barriers to prevent the virtuous from reaching their cashes or sanctuaries. Fortunately, the great wizard Jaanth Nor devised a countering magic for the effects of all venom and recorded his findings for future generations to use. The Cure spell is effected by the use of a mixture of Garlic and Ginseng and the calling of the victim’s name to soothe the envenomed soul. The curative powers of the Ginseng nullify the effects of the poison in the victim’s system, while the use of Garlic wards off the return of any virulent residues that may lie dormant in the blood.
