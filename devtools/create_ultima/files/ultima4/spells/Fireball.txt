Fireball
When beset upon by evil, the spellcaster has many offensive tools at his or her disposal. We have discussed some of the indirect magics such as Energy Fields, but there are times when more direct action is required. There is a class of missile spells for such occasions, of which the Fireball spell is the intermediate one. All such spells call for the use of the precious Black Pearl for its power in the launching of projectiles. In the case of the Fireball, Sulphurous Ash is also called for in equal proportion, for its powers of fireflash are integral to the creation of flaming missiles. Speak the name of your enemy when the spell is cast and your aim shall be unerring and your enemy will be devastated by the flames of the magical fires.
