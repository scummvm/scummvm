Energy Field
There are four types of Energy Fields known to the practitioner of the mystic arts: Sleep, Poison, Fire, and Lightning. Their effects are varied, but the magic used to erect them is the same in each instance. Any person attempting to pass through an Energy Field will run the risk of either falling asleep or being poisoned in the case of the first two types; if the field is of Fire then their flesh shall burn as they pass through and they shall feel much pain and anguish; while the field composed of lighting is impenetrable.
  The casting of Energy Fields is not difficult and requires only a small exertion on the part of the spellcaster, but the fields, are only effective in enclosed areas such as subterranean passages and inside of rooms. The reagents necessary in the casting of these Energy Fields are Sulphurous Ash for the burst of creation, Spider Silk for the binding of forces to a single spot, and Black Pearl for the launching of the spell to a spot away from he who works the magic. It would be a grave error indeed to cast such a spell without the latter components, for you would find yourself in the midst of the field!
