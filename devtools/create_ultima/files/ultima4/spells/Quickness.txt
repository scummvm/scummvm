Quickness
The spell of Quickness is one the most unpredictable yet potent spells in the wizard’s collection of enchantments, and one of the most telling on his or her companions. When cast during battle, the Quickness spell will heighten the natural dexterity of one’s fellows to such a degree that they will move with twice their normal agility -- at times they will be able to land two blows against their foes instead of the customary single strike during a round of combat. The price is age, for the recipients of the extra speed incurred by the use of Quickness will age briefly while under the sway of the enchantment... yet most feel that an occasional grey hair is but a small price to pay for the advantage of dealing twice the number of blows that one might receive.
  The reagents for the Quickness spell are fiery Sulphurous Ash, Ginseng, and volatile Blood Moss. The Blood Moss portion is double the others, for movement is the critical aspect of the spell. The Sulphurous Ash lends the flashes of energy needed by the beneficiaries of the enchantment, while the healing powers of Ginseng prevent them from aging so rapidly as to become greybeards after a single encounter. Throughout the course of the Quickness spell, the spellcaster will be reminded of its effects by the vision of a bright, glowing “Q”.
