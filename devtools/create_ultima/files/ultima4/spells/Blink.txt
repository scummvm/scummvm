Blink
Many are the occasions that the thaumaturge needs to be elsewhere in very short order and finds that neither horse nor ship nor any other conventional form of travel is of sufficient promptness for the situation. Magical means of travel must then be used, of which the Blink spell is the most common. This spell disassembles the mage and companions and reassembles them at a spot many leagues distant in any chosen direction. There are means of travel that cover far great distances than the Blink, but they are far more costly and have other limitations which we shall examine later in this perceptible to the mind of a common person.
  The components needed for the casting of a Blink spell are Spider Silk and Blood Moss. The binding powers of the Spider Silk prevent the essence of the travelers from being scattered during transit, while the Blood Moss aids in the movement from one location to the next. Equal quantities of each reagent ensure the proper working of the enchantment. The concentration required for Blinking is such that the spellcaster will most certainly feel the effects, but not be left exhausted.
