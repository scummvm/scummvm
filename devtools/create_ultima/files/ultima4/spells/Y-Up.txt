Y-Up
The two most elementary forms of teleportation both have strange names and may be used only when underground. The more difficult of the two is known by the letter “Y” in honor of the mage Yenthak Gnor, who first crafted the enchantment. Yenthak Gnor discovered that a blend of Blood Moss and Spider Silk, in conjunction with the spoken names of the moons, would cause on who utters it to be lifted upward through the very soil to the next highest level of a dungeon. The Spider Silk holds the party together during their transit, while the Blood Moss moves them ever closer to the moons.
