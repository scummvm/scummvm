Awaken
Should you or any of your followers ever be so unfortunate as to come under the influence of a magically induced slumber, the use of a Spell of Awakening will often alleviate the condition. It is a simple spell which may be cast by the beginning student of the mystic arts with little effort or cost. It requires the use of Ginseng for its healing qualities, and Garlic in order to ward off the coming of sleep until the victim's body has returned to its normal cycle of wakefulness and rest. Blend the two reagents very carefully, apply the mixture to the brow of your sleeping companion, and then chant “levate” loudly.
