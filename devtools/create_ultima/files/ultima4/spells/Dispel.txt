Dispel
One of the staples of the wizardâ€™s profession is the use of energy fields. We shall discuss the casting of such fields shortly, but first let us examine the means of dismantling them when they are encountered. Although there are various forms of such fields, they are all created with a similar magic and thus may be Dispelled with a single spell. The Dispel enchantment is one of moderate difficulty, far more exhausting then the creation of energy disastrous, so the enchantment must be cast from afar and thus required the used of the precious Black Pearl needed in all projectile spells. Furthermore, Sulfurous Ash is needed to provide the flash of power that brings the dissolution of the forces holding the field together. Finally, the warding powers of Garlic are also employed to prevent concentrated. To effect the spell, speak backward the color of the type of field encountered.
