Magic Missile
There are generally very few if any spells that are learned early in the practice of wizardry which are both useful and eagerly sought after by those dabbling in the mystic arts. The beginning thaumaturge almost always yearns for spells that devastate or create startling effects. The weaving of weather or the mastery of short vertical teleportations do not impress onlookers. The one simple spell that does truly inspire awe at little expense to the spellcaster is the Magic Missile. It requires the use of two parts of Sulphurous Ash to one part of Black Pearl in the casting, and it will cause a tremendously bright flash of blue light to strike an enemy. While not visibly marked, the enemy will sustain a fair amount of internal damage, said by the cynical to be brought about by fright more than by power. The Magic Missile is a useful enchantment in battle, but it is more spectacular than effective and will not deter most enemies larger that the spellcaster who wields it.
