Negate
When faced with a greater or more telling magic than one’s own, the practitioner of the mystic arts may decide it best for all involved to suspend everyone’s use of thaumaturgy for a short time. At this time one should invoke the powers of the Negate spell by mixing Garlic with its warding characteristics together with the exotic Mandrake ripe with mystic potency. To this blend add but an equal amount of Sulphurous Ash to provide the spark of fusion and speak your own name backward. All magic shall instantly cease save the enchantment of Negation itself, which is manifested by the vision of a glowing “N” hovering before your eyes. The Negate spell will last only a brief time, which should be used for either the annihilation of your enemies or for the judicious removal of your presence from the troubled spot.
