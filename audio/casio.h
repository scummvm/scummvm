/**
 * MIDI driver implementation for the Casio MT-540, CT-640 and CSM-1 devices.
 *
 * This driver provides source volume and user volume scaling, as well as
 * fades (due to device limitations these are applied to note velocity instead
 * of the volume controller). It also provides instrument mapping between the
 * MT-540 and CT-640/CSM-1 instrument map and can map rhythm notes from the 
 * input MIDI data by specifying a remapping.
 *
 * TODO This driver does not provide a full multisource functionality
 * implementation because this was not needed for the game for which it was
 * added (Elvira). It assumes only 1 source sends MIDI data at the same time
 * and this source has access to all MIDI channels.
 *
 * Some details of these Casio devices:
 * - They seem to support only note on, note off and program change MIDI
 *   events. Because they do not support the volume controller, volume is
 *   applied to note velocity (and I'm not sure if they support even that...).
 *   All Notes Off is performed by keeping track of active notes and sending
 *   note off events for all active notes.
 * - They only use MIDI channels 0-3. The MT-32 and GM devices have channel 9
 *   as the fixed rhythm channel. The Casio devices can switch any used channel
 *   to a rhythm channel by setting a specific instrument.
 * - They have only 30 instruments, 3 of which are rhythm or SFX banks.
 * - All devices seem to have the same capabilities, but the instrument
 *   numbering is different between the MT-540 on the one hand and the CT-640
 *   and CSM-1 on the other.
