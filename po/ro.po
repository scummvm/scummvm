"## ScummVM at a Glance\n"
"\n"
"ScummVM is a modern reimplementation of various game engines. Once you "
"transfer the original game data to your device, it endeavors to use it to "
"faithfully recreate the original gaming experience. \n"
"\n"
"ScummVM isn't your typical emulator of DOS, Windows, or some console. Rather "
"than a one-size-fits-all approach, it takes a meticulous route, implementing "
"the precise game logic for each specific title or engine it supports. "
"ScummVM will not work with game engines it does not support.\n"
"\n"
"ScummVM is developed by a team of volunteers and is free software. We lack "
"an extensive testing team, possess only a limited range of devices, and "
"cannot always address every request. We also do not run advertisements or "
"sell you anything. Please be mindful of this when you submit a complaint or "
"a bug report.\n"
"\n"
"## Where to get the games\n"
"\n"
"Visit [our Wiki](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?"
"title=Where_to_get_the_games) for a detailed list of supported games and "
"where to purchase them.\n"
"\n"
"Alternatively, you can download a variety of [freeware games](https://"
"scummvm.org/games) and [demos](https://www.scummvm.org/demos/) directly from "
"our website.\n"
"\n"
"The ScummVM team does not endorse any specific game supplier. However, the "
"project receives a commission from every purchase made on [ZOOM-Platform]"
"(https://www.zoom-platform.com/?"
"affiliate=c049516c-9c4c-42d6-8649-92ed870e8b53) through affiliate referral "
"links.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally, games not available on ZOOM-Platform can be found on other "
"suppliers such as GOG.com and Steam.\n"
"\n"
"For other (out-of-print) games, consider checking platforms like Amazon, "
"eBay, Game Trading Zone, or other auction sites. Be cautious of faulty games "
"and illegal game copies.\n"
