	 * @defgroup common_system_graphics Graphics
	 * @ingroup common_system
	 * @{
	 *
	 * The way graphics work in the OSystem class is meant to make
	 * it possible for game frontends to implement everything they need in
	 * an efficient manner. The downside of this is that it may be
	 * rather complicated for backend authors to fully understand and
	 * implement the semantics of the OSystem interface.
	 *
	 * The graphics visible to the user in the end are actually
	 * composed of three layers: the game graphics, the overlay
	 * graphics, and the mouse.
	 *
	 * First, there are the game graphics. The methods in this section
	 * deal with them exclusively. In particular, the size of the game
	 * graphics is defined by a call to initSize(), and
	 * copyRectToScreen() blits the data in the current pixel format
	 * into the game layer. Let W and H denote the width and height of
	 * the game graphics.
	 *
	 * Before the user sees these graphics, the backend may apply some
	 * transformations to it. For example, they may be scaled to better
	 * fit the visible screen or aspect ratio correction may be
	 * performed (see kFeatureAspectRatioCorrection). As a result of
	 * this, a pixel of the game graphics may occupy a region bigger
	 * than a single pixel on the screen. p_w and p_h are defined to be
	 * the width and, respectively, height of a game pixel on the screen.
	 *
	 * In addition, there is a vertical "shake offset" (as defined by
	 * setShakePos) that is used in some games to provide a shaking
	 * effect. Note that shaking is applied to all three layers, i.e.
	 * also to the overlay and the mouse. The shake offset is denoted
	 * by S.
	 *
	 * Putting this together, a pixel (x,y) of the game graphics is
	 * transformed to a rectangle of height p_h and width p_w
	 * appearing at position (p_w * x, p_hw * (y + S)) on the real
	 * screen. In addition, a backend may choose to offset
	 * everything, e.g. to center the graphics on the screen.
	 *
	 * The next layer is the overlay. It is composed over the game
	 * graphics. Historically, the overlay size had always been a
	 * multiple of the game resolution. For example, if the game
	 * resolution was 320x200 and the user selected a 2x scaler and did
	 * not enable aspect ratio correction, it had a size of 640x400.
	 * An exception was the aspect ratio correction, which did allow
	 * for non multiples of the vertical resolution of the game screen.
	 * Currently, the overlay size does not need to have any relation to
	 * the game resolution though, for example the overlay resolution
	 * might be the same as the physical screen resolution.
	 * The overlay is forced to a 16 bpp mode right now.
	 *
	 * Finally, there is the mouse layer. This layer does not have to
	 * actually exist within the backend -- it all depends on how a
	 * backend chooses to implement mouse cursors. However, in the default
	 * SDL backend, it really is a separate layer. The mouse can
	 * have a palette of its own, if the backend supports it.
	 *
	 * Graphics do not need to be thread-safe and in fact most/all backends
	 * using OpenGL are not. So do *not* try to call any of these functions
	 * from a timer and/or audio callback (like readBuffer of AudioStreams).
