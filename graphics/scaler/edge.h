	 *
	 * No matter how you do it, mapping 3 bitplanes into a single greyscale
	 * bitplane will always result in colors which are very different mapping to
	 * the same greyscale value.  Inevitably, these pixels will appear next to
	 * each other at some point in some image, and edge detection on a single
	 * bitplane will behave quite strangely due to them having the same or nearly
	 * the same greyscale values.  Calculating distances between pixels using all
	 * three RGB bitplanes is *way* too time consuming, so single bitplane
	 * edge detection is used for speed's sake.  In order to try to avoid the
	 * color mapping problems of using a single bitplane, 3 different greyscale
	 * mappings are tested for each 3x3 grid, and the one with the most "signal"
	 * (sum of squares difference from center pixel) is chosen.  This usually
	 * results in useable contrast within the 3x3 grid.
	 *
	 * This results in a whopping 25% increase in overall runtime of the filter
	 * over simply using luma or some other single greyscale bitplane, but it
	 * does greatly reduce the amount of errors due to greyscale mapping
	 * problems.  I think this is the best compromise between accuracy and
	 * speed, and is still a lot faster than edge detecting over all three RGB
	 * bitplanes.  The increase in image quality is well worth the speed hit.
