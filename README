1.0) About:
---- ------ 
ScummVM is a collection of interpreters, capable of emulating several
adventure game engines. ScummVM mainly supports engines created using 
SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), used in various
LucasArts games such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, and others.
ScummVM also contains interpreters for several non-SCUMM games, currently
these are Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword II and Simon the Sorcerer 1 & 2

At this time ScummVM should be considered beta software, and is still
under heavy development. Be aware that whilst we attempt to make sure
that many games can be completed with few major bugs, crashes can happen. 

If you enjoy ScummVM feel free to donate using the PayPal button on the
ScummVM homepage. This will help us buy utilities needed to develop ScummVM
easier and quicker. If you cannot donate, help and contribute a patch!

2.0) Contacting:
---- ----------
The easiest way to contact the ScummVM team is by submitting bug reports or
commenting in our forums. You can also join and e-mail the scummvm-devel
mailing list, or chat with us on irc (#scummvm on irc.freenode.net)
Please do not ask us to support an unsupported game - read our homepages
FAQ first.

2.1) Reporting Bugs:
---- ---------------
To report a bug, please create a SourceForge account and follow the bugs
link from our homepage. Please make sure the bug is reproducible, and
still occurs in the latest daily build/current CVS version. Also check
the known bugs list (below) and compatibility listing for that game, to
ensure the issue is not already known.

Also do not report bugs on games that are not listed as being completable
in the 'Supported Games' section, or compatibility list. We -know- those
games have bugs.

Please include the following information:
        - ScummVM version (PLEASE test the latest CVS/Daily build)
        - Bug details, including instructions on reproducing
        - Language of game (English, German, ...)
        - Version of game (talkie, floppy, ...)
        - Platform and Compiler (Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, ...)
        - Attach a save game if possible
        - If this bug only occurred recently, please note the last
          version without the bug, and the first version including
          the bug. That way we can fix it quicker by looking at the
          changes made.

3.0) Supported Games:
---- ----------------
At the moment the following games have been reported to work, and should
be playable to the end. However, this list generally applies to PC versions.

     Broken Sword II                               [Game: sword2]

The following games should load, but are not yet fully playable. Play these at
your own risk, and please do not file bug reports about them. If you want
the latest updates on game compatibility, visit our web site and view the
compatibility chart.

     Putt-Putt Goes To The Moon                    [Game: puttmoon]
     Putt-Putt's Fun Pack                          [Game: funpack]

     Fatty Bear's Fun Pack                         [Game: fbpack]

The following games are SCUMM engine, but NOT supported by ScummVM (yet).

     Putt-Putt Joins the Parade
     Most other Humongous Entertainment titles

Please be aware that the engine may contain bugs and unimplemented features
that sometimes make it impossible to finish the game. Save often, and please
file a bug report (instructions on submitting bug reports are below) if you
encounter such a bug in a 'supported' game.

3.1) Copy Protection:
---- ----------------
The ScummVM team does not condone piracy. However, there are cases when
LucasArts themselves bundled cracked interpreters with their own games --
the data files still contain the copy protection scripts, but the interpreter
bypasses them. There is no way for us to tell the difference between legitimate
and pirated data files, so for the games where we know the original interpreter
may have been cracked ScummVM will always have to bypass the copy protection.

At the time of writing, that includes the following games:

Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade (EGA)
Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade (256 color FM Towns version)
Loom (16 color floppy version)
Maniac Mansion
Monkey Island 1 (EGA)
Monkey Island 1 (VGA)
Monkey Island 2
Zak McKracken (EGA)
Zak McKracken (256 color FM Towns version)

Beneath a Steel Sky (bypassed with permission from Revolution)

In most cases ScummVM will still show the copy protection screen. Try entering
any answer. Chances are that it will work.

3.2) Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 notes:
---- ---------------------------------
The Simon the Sorcerer 1 & 2 games were split into several targets to make
coding easier and to make it more clear which target should be used:
       simon1dos    - Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 for DOS (Disk)
       simon2dos    - Use for Simon the Sorcerer 2 for DOS (Disk)
       simon1talkie - Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 Talkie for DOS (CD)
       simon2talkie - Use for Simon the Sorcerer 2 Talkie for DOS (CD)
       simon1win    - Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 Talkie for Windows (CD)
       simon2win    - Use for Simon the Sorcerer 2 Talkie for Windows (CD)
       simon2mac    - Use for Simon the Sorcerer 2 Talkie for Amiga or Mac (CD)

If you have the dual version of Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2 on CD,
then you will find the Windows version in the main directory of CD
and the DOS Talkie version in the DOS directory of the CD.

3.3) Known Problems in ScummVM 0.5.5-cvs
---- -----------------------------------
This release has the following known problems. There is no need to report them,
although patches to fix them are welcome. If you discover a bug that is not
listed here, nor in the compatibility table on the web site, please see
the section on Reporting Bugs.

// FIXME: Are these two still present? Many walk-related fixes lately...
       Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade (EGA):
                - In some rooms Indy may be able to walk to odd places

       Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade (256):
                - In some rooms Indy may be able to walk to odd places

       FM Towns versions:
                - Kanji versions require the FM Towns Font ROM
                - All the FM Towns versions of games are extremely rare,
                  And as the ScummVM team does not encourage piracy in any
                  way, we don't know where to buy or download a copy of these
                  games. Petition LucasArts to re-release them :)

       Loom (EGA):
                - MIDI support requires the Roland update from LucasArts

       Monkey Island 1 (EGA):
                - MIDI support requires the Roland update from LucasArts

       Sam and Max:
                - Highway subgame does not behave correctly.
                - Music is broken under Dreamcast, causing game freezes

       Beneath a Steel Sky:
                - Floppy demo does not work at all
                - Amiga versions aren't supported and probably never will be
                - Not a bug: CD version is missing speech for some dialog
                - ScummVM 0.5.0 contained a bug in the savegame system.
                  If you experience problems using an old savegame, it may be
                  corrupt, and you will need to start a new game using this
                  version.

       Simon the Sorcerer 1:
                - No inventory scrolling arrows shown in simon1dos and
                  simon1talkie, can still move around inventory though.

       Simon the Sorcerer 2:
                - Text in copy protection screen of simon2dos is only shown for
                  a short time
                - simon2dos and simon2talkie (With subtitles enabled) freeze 
                  briefly when Pirate Captain is talking to Mate, when Simon
                  tries to escape
                - Only default language in data files is supported in simon2mac
                - F10 key animation in simon2mac is different compared to
                  original game

       Curse of Monkey Island
                - The "Pirate Song" scene does not play correctly
                - Some minor graphical glitches remain

       All CD games:
               - If you are experiencing random crashes, and your game
                 plays music from CD, you have encountered a Windows bug.
                 Try copying the data files from CD to your hard disk, and
                 running them from there.


4.0) Supported Platforms:
---- --------------------
ScummVM has been ported to run on many platforms and operating systems.
Links to these ports can be found either on the ScummVM web page or by a
Google search. Many thanks to the effort of porters. If you have a port of
ScummVM and wish to commit it into the main CVS, feel free to contact us!

        Windows         - SDL
        Windows CE      - SDL            (iPaq and other handheld devices)
        Linux           - X11/OSS audio  (includes iPaqs running Linux)
        Mac OS X        - SDL
        AmigaOS         - SDL
        MorphOS         - Custom backend
        BeOS            - SDL
        Acorn (RiscOS)  - ???
        Dreamcast       - Custom backend 
        GP32            - Custom backend
        PalmOS          - Custom backend
        UNIX            - SDL            (Linux, Solaris, IRIX, *BSD)

The Dreamcast port does not support Curse of Monkey Island, nor The Dig.
The PalmOS port does not support Curse of Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel
Sky, nor either Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2. The Dig will only work on some
Palm devices (those with a large dynamic heap).

5.0) Running ScummVM:
---- ----------------
Before you run the engine, you need to put the game's datafiles in a
directory. The filenames must not be in mixed case on *nix systems
(for example, these are valid names: "monkey2.000", "MONKEY2.000", while
this is a bad one: "Monkey2.000"). If you use a game with speech, the file
monster.sou must reside in the same directory as the datafiles.

Please note that by default, ScummVM will save games in the directory
it is executed from, so you should refrain from running it from more than
one location. Further information, including how to specify a specific save
directory to avoid this issue, are in section 6.0.

ScummVM can be launched directly by running the executable. In this case,
the in-built launcher will activate. From this, you can add games (click
'Add Game'), or launch games which have already been configured.

ScummVM can also be launched into a game directly using Command Line
arguments - see the next section.

5.1) Command Line Options:
---- ---------------------

  [GAME]                   Short name of game to load. For example, 'monkey'
                           for Monkey Island. This can be either a built-in
                           gameid, or a user configured target.

  -v, --version            Display ScummVM version information and exit

                           exists in the current directory

  --cdrom=NUM              CD drive to play CD audio from (default: 0 = first
                           drive)
  --joytick[=NUM]          Enable input with joystick (default: 0 = first
                           joystick)
  --platform=WORD          Specify version of game (allowed values: amiga,
                           atari, mac, pc)
  --multi-midi             Enable combination of Adlib and native MIDI

  --talkspeed=NUM          Set talk speed for SCUMM games (default: 60)


The meaning of most long options can be inverted by prefixing them with "no-",
e.g. --no-aspect-ratio. This is useful if you want to override a setting in the
configuration file.

The short game name ('game target') you see at the end of the command
line is very important. A short list is contained at the top of this
file. You can also get the current list of games and game names at:

5.3) Graphics filters:
---- -----------------
ScummVM offers several anti-aliasing filters to attempt to improve visual
quality. These are the same filters used in many other emulators, such as
MAME. These filters take the original game graphics, and scale it by a 
certain fixed factor (usually 2x or 3x) before displaying them to you.
So for example, if the game originally run at a resolution of 320x200
(typical for most of the SCUMM games), then using a filter with scale
factor 2x will effectively yield 640x400 graphics. Likewise with a 
3x filter you'll get 960x600.

They are:
        normal     - No filtering, no scaling. Fastest.
        2x         - No filtering, factor 2x (default).
        3x         - No filtering, factor 3x.
        2xsai      - 2xsai filter, factor 2x.
        super2xsai - Enhanced 2xsai filtering, factor 2x.
        supereagle - Less blurry than 2xsai, but slower. Factor 2x.
        advmame2x  - Doesn't rely on blurring like 2xSAI, fast. Factor 2x.
        advmame3x  - Doesn't rely on blurring like 2xSAI, fast. Factor 3x.
        hq2x       - Very nice high quality filter but slow. Factor 2x.
        hq3x       - Very nice high quality filter but slow. Factor 3x.
        tv2x       - Interlace filter, tries to emulate a TV. Factor 2x.
        dotmatrix  - Dot matrix effect. Factor 2x.
        opengl     - OpenGL with bilinear filtering [Unsupported]

To select a graphics filter, pass its name via the '-g' option to scummvm,
for example:

    scummvm -g advmame2x monkey2

Note #1: Not all backends support all or any filters. The ones listed above
are for the default SDL backend.

Note #2: Filters can be very slow when ScummVM is compiled in a debug
configuration without optimizations. And there is always a speed impact when
using any form of anti-aliasing/linear filtering.

Note #3: The Fm Towns version of Zak (zaktowns target) uses an original 
resolution of 320x240 - hence for this game scalers will scale to 
640x480 or 960x720.

Note #4: The OpenGL filter is included as a curiosity only. It's use is
unsupported, and unrecommended. The only benefit is hardware accelerated
scaling, but any machine with an OpenGL card should be fast enough to use
the software scalers (see above).

5.4 Hot Keys:
--- ---------
ScummVM supports various in game hotkeys. They differ between the SCUMM and
simon games.

    Common:
        Ctrl-z OR Alt-x        - Quit
        Keyboard Arrow Keys    - Simulate mouse movement
        Ctrl-f                 - Toggle fast mode.
        Ctrl-Alt 1-8           - Switch between graphics filters
        Ctrl-Alt + and -       - Increase/Decrease the scale factor
        Ctrl-Alt b             - Switch between bilinear and non-linear
                                 filtering [OpenGL backend]
        Ctrl-Alt a             - Toggle aspect-ratio correction on/off.
                                 Most of the games use a 320x200 pixel
                                 resolution, which may look squashed on
                                 modern monitors. Aspect-ratio correction
                                 stretches the image to use 320x240 pixels
                                 instead, or a multiple thereof.

    SCUMM:
        Ctrl 0-9 and Alt 0-9   - Load and save game state
        Ctrl-g                 - Runs in really REALLY fast mode.
        Ctrl-d                 - Starts the debugger.
        Tilde (~)              - Show/hide the debugging console
        Ctrl-s                 - Shows memory consumption.
        [ and ]                - Music volume, down/up
        - and +                - Text speed, slower/faster
        F5                     - Displays a save/load box.
        Space                  - Pauses
        Period (.)             - Skips current line of text in some games
        Alt-Enter              - Toggles full screen/windowed
        Enter                  - Simulate left mouse button press
        Tab                    - Simulate right mouse button press

    Simon:
        F1 - F3                - Text speed, faster - slower
        F10                    - Shows all characters and objects you can 
                                 interact with

        t                      - Switch between speech and subtitles
        v                      - Switch between subtitles only and
                                 combined speech & subtitles.
                                 [Simon the Sorcerer 2 only]

    Beneath a Steel Sky:
        Ctrl-g                 - Runs in really REALLY fast mode.
        F5                     - Displays a save/load box.
        Escape                 - Skips the game intro.
        Period (.)             - Skips current line of text.

Note that using ctrl-f and ctrl-g are not recommended: games can crash when
being ran faster than their normal speed, as scripts will lose synchronisation

5.5 Using data files from Macintosh game versions:
--- ----------------------------------------------
All LucasArts SCUMM based adventures except CMI also exist in versions for the
Macintosh. ScummVM can use most (all?) of them, however, in some case some
additional work is required. First off, if you are not using a Macintosh for
this, accessing the CD/floppy data might be tricky. There are various tools on
the net for this, though.

Secondly, most of the newer games shipped only with a  single data file on the
Macintosh. You first have to run the 'rescumm' tool from the scummvm-tools
package to extract the data files ScummVM expects. You invoke rescumm like
this (where DATAFILE is the path to the single big data file):

   rescumm DATAFILE

It will extract the data into the current directory, so make sure to run it from
a writable directory.

6.0) Savegames:
---- ----------
Savegames are by default put in the current directory. You can specify the save
in the config file by setting the savepath parameter. See the example config
file later in this readme.

You can also use the environment variable SCUMMVM_SAVEPATH to specify where to
put save games. Don't forget the trailing directory separator. Also be aware
that saved games may break between ScummVM releases.

Bash (Unix) example:
        export SCUMMVM_SAVEPATH=/tmp/scummvm_savegames/

Windows example:
        set SCUMMVM_SAVEPATH=C:\saved_games\

6.1) Autosaves:
---- ----------
Because ScummVM is still a beta product, it -can- crash and/or hang
occasionally. As such, every five minutes it will save a game in Slot 0. This
game can be loaded via Ctrl-0, or the F5 menu. This autosaving does not, 
however, occur with Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2.


7.0) Music and Sound: 
---- ----------------
By default, on most operating systems, ScummVM will automatically use Adlib
emulation. MIDI may not be available on all operating systems or may need
manual configuration. If you ARE using MIDI, you have several different
choices of output, depending on your operating system and configuration.
        
        adlib     - Uses internal Adlib Emulation (default)
        pcjr      - Uses internal PCjr Emulation 
        pcspk     - Uses internal PC Speaker Emulation
        towns     - Uses FM-Towns YM2612 Emulation
        windows   - Windows MIDI. Uses built-in sequencer, for Windows users
        seq       - Uses /dev/sequencer for MIDI, *nix users. See below.
        qt        - Quicktime sound, for Macintosh users.
        core      - CoreAudio sound, for MacOS X users.
        amidi     - Uses the MorphOS MIDI system, for MorphOS users
        alsa      - Output using ALSA sequencer device. See below.
        null      - Null output. Don't play any music.

To select a sound driver, pass its name via the '-e' option to scummvm,
for example:

    scummvm -e adlib monkey2


7.1) Playing sound with Adlib emulation:
---- -----------------------------------
By default an Adlib card will be emulated and ScummVM will output the music
as sampled waves. This is the default mode for most games, and offers the
best compatibility between machines and games.


7.2) Playing sound with MIDI emulation:
---- ----------------------------------
Some games (such as Sam and Max) only contain MIDI music data.  This once
prevented music for these games from working on platforms that do not support
MIDI, or soundcards that do not provide MIDI drivers (e.g, many soundcards will
not play MIDI under Linux). ScummVM can now emulate MIDI mode using sampled
waves and Adlib emulation using the -eadlib option.  However, if you are capable
of using native MIDI, we recommend using one of the MIDI modes below for best
sound.

7.3) Playing sound with Native MIDI:
---- -------------------------------
Use the appropriate -e<mode> command line option from the list above to
select your preferred MIDI device. For example, if you wish to use the
Windows MIDI driver, use the -ewindows option.


7.4.0 Playing sound with Sequencer MIDI:                        [UNIX ONLY]
----- ----------------------------------
If your soundcard driver supports a sequencer, you may set the environment
variable "SCUMMVM_MIDI" to your sequencer device - e.g., /dev/sequencer

If you have problems with not hearing audio in this configuration, it is
possible you will need to set the "SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT" variable to 1 or 2. This
selects the port on the selected sequencer to use. Then start scummvm with the
-eseq parameter. This should work on several cards, and may offer better
performance and quality than Adlib emulation. However, for those systems where
sequencer support does not work, you can always fall back on Adlib emulation.


7.4.1 Playing sound with ALSA sequencer:                        [UNIX ONLY]
----- ----------------------------------
If you have installed the ALSA driver with the sequencer support, then
set the environment variable "SCUMMVM_PORT" to your sequencer port - e.g. 65:0

Here is a little howto on how to use the ALSA sequencer with your soundcard.
In all cases, to have a list of all the sequencer ports you have, try the
command "aconnect -o -l". This should give output similar to:
client 64: 'External MIDI 0' [type=kernel]
    0 'MIDI 0-0        '
client 65: 'Emu10k1 WaveTable' [type=kernel]
    0 'Emu10k1 Port 0  '
    1 'Emu10k1 Port 1  '
    2 'Emu10k1 Port 2  '
    3 'Emu10k1 Port 3  '
client 128: 'Client-128' [type=user]
    0 'TiMidity port 0 '
    1 'TiMidity port 1 '

This means the external MIDI output of the sound card is located on the
port 64:0, four WaveTable MIDI outputs in 65:0, 65:1, 65:2
and 65:3, and two TiMidity ports, located at 128:0 and 128:1.

If you have a FM-chip on your card, like the SB16, then you have to load
the soundfonts using the sbiload software. Example:
  sbiload -p 65:0 /etc/std.o3 /etc/drums.o3

If you have a WaveTable capable sound card, you have to load a sbk or sf2
soundfont using the sfxload software. Example:
  sfxload /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2

If you don't have a MIDI capable soundcard, there are two options: FluidSynth
and TiMidity. We recommend FluidSynth, as on many systems TiMidity will 'lag'
behind music. This is very noticable in iMUSE-enabled games, which use fast
and dynamic music transitions. Running TiMidity as root will allow it to
setup real time priority, which may reduce music lag.

Asking TiMidity to become an ALSA sequencer:
  timidity -iAqqq -B2,8 -Os1S -s 44100 &
(If you get distorted output with this setting, you can try dropping the 
-B2,8 or changing the value. To reduce the possibility of )

Asking FluidSynth to become an ALSA sequencer (using SoundFonts):
  fluidsynth -m alsa_seq /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2

Once either TiMidity or FluidSynth are running, use the 'aconnect -o -l' 
command as described earlier in this section.

7.5.0) Using MP3 files for CD audio:
------ -----------------------------
Use LAME or some other mp3 encoder to rip the cd audio tracks to files. Name
the files track1.mp3 track2.mp3 etc. ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support
to use this option. You'll need to rip the file from the CD as a WAV file,
then encode the MP3 files in constant bit rate. This can be done with the 
following LAME command line:

  lame -t -q 0 -b 96 track1.wav track1.mp3


7.5.1) Using Ogg Vorbis files for CD audio:
------ ------------------------------------
Use oggenc or some other vorbis encoder to encode the audio tracks to files.
Name the files track1.ogg track2.ogg etc. ScummVM must be compiled with vorbis
support to use this option. You'll need to rip the files from the CD as a WAV
file, then encode the vorbis files. This can be done with the following oggenc
command line with the value after q specifying the desired quality from 0 to 10:

  oggenc -q 5 track1.wav


7.5.2) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with MP3:
------ ---------------------------------
You need LAME, and our extract util from the scummvm-tools package to perform
this task, and ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support.

Make a backup file of your MONSTER.SOU before attempting this. Copy your
MONSTER.SOU file to a temporary folder. Then run:

  extract monster.sou

In about 30 minutes or so, you will have a much smaller monster.so3 file,
copy this file to your game directory. You can safely remove the monster.sou
file.


7.5.3) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Ogg Vorbis:
------ ----------------------------------------
As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with OGG support. Run:

  extract --vorbis monster.sou

This should produce a smaller monster.sog file, which you should copy to your
game directory. Ogg encoding may take a considerable longer amount of time
than MP3, so have a good book handy.


7.5.4) Compressing sfx/speech in Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2
------ ----------------------------------------------------
You need LAME, and our simon2mp3 util from the scummvm-tools package to perform
this task, and ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support.

Make a backup of the file before attempting this. Copy the file to a
temporary folder. Then run:

  simon2mp3 effects     (For simon1acorn)
  simon2mp3 simon       (For simon1acorn)
  simon2mp3 effects.voc (For simon1talkie)
  simon2mp3 simon.voc   (For simon1talkie)
  simon2mp3 simon.wav   (For simon1win)
  simon2mp3 simon2.voc  (For simon2talkie)
  simon2mp3 simon2.wav  (For simon2win) 


In about 30 minutes or so, you will have a much smaller *.mp3 file, copy this
file to your game dir. You can safely remove the old file.


8.0) Configuration file:
---- -------------------
By default, the configuration file is saved in, and loaded from:

        Windows:  <windir>\scummvm.ini,
        Unix:     ~/.scummvmrc
        Mac OS X: ~/Library/Preferences/ScummVM Preferences
        Others:   scummvm.ini in the current directory

An example config file looks as follows:

9.0 Compiling:
--- ----------
You need SDL-1.2.2 or newer (older versions may work, but are unsupported), and
a supported compiler. Several compilers, including GCC, mingw and Microsoft
Visual C++ are supported. If you wish to use MP3-compressed CD tracks or
.SOU files, you will need to install the MAD library and define
USE_MAD. Tools for compressing .SOU files to .SO3 files can be
found in the 'tools' CVS module, or in the 'scummvm-tools' package.

You can also comment/uncomment appropriate lines in the build.rules file to
use sdl_gl.cpp instead of sdl.cpp. This allows hardware accelerated bilinear
filtering by using OpenGL textures.

On Win9x/NT/XP you can define USE_WINDBG and attach WinDbg to browse debug 
messages (see http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml).

    GCC:
        * Type ./configure
        * Type make (or gmake if that's what GNU make is called on your
          system) and hopefully ScummVM will compile for you.

    Mingw - Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003:
        * Open Makefile.mingw, alter SDL paths and choose compiling options.
        * Type make -f Makefile.mingw,  hopefully ScummVM will compile for you.

    Microsoft Visual C++:
        * Open the workspace, scummwm.dsw
        * Enter the path to the SDL include files in Tools|Options|Directories
        * Now it should compile successfully.

    PocketPC - Windows CE:
        * Download the SDLAudio library:
          http://arisme.free.fr/PocketScumm/sources/SDLAudio-1.2.3-src.zip
        * Open and compile the SDLAudio WCEBuild/WCEBuild workspace in EVC++
        * Open the ScummVM wince/PocketScumm workspace
        * Enter the SDLAudio directory to your includes path
        * Enter the compiled SDLAudio.lib to your link libraries list
        * Now it should compile successfully

    Debian GNU/Linux:
        * Install the packages 'build-essential', 'fakeroot', 'debhelper',
          'libsdl1.2-dev', and 'libmad0-dev' on your system.
        * Optional: Install the 'libvorbis-dev' and/or the 'libasound2-dev'
          packages, and edit the Makefile to turn on support for Ogg Vorbis
          and/or the ALSA sequencer.
        * Run 'make deb'.
        * Finally run 'dpkg -i ../scummvm-cvs*deb', and you're done.
        
    Mac OS X:
        * Make sure you have the developer tools installed.
        * Edit backends/sdl/build.rules, and enable the Mac OS X specific 
          line(s).
        * Depending on where you have installed SDL, you have to add the
          location of its headers to the INCLUDES variables. For example if you
          installed SDL via Fink, you can add this at the end of build.rules:
          INCLUDES+= -I/sw/include
        * You can now 'make' to create a command line binary.
        * To get a version you can run from Finder, type 'make bundle' which
          will create ScummVM.app.

        Jim Leiterman   - Various info on his Fm Towns/Marty SCUMM ports
        Jimmi Thogersen - For ScummRev, and much obscure code/documentation

        Tony Warriner and everyone at Revolution Software Ltd. for sharing
        with us the source of some of their brilliant games, allowing us to
        release Beneath a Steel Sky as freeware... and generally being
        supportive above and beyond the call of duty.

        Aric Wilmunder, Ron Gilbert, David Fox, Vince Lee, and all those at
        LucasFilm/LucasArts who made SCUMM the insane mess to reimplement
        that it is today. Feel free to drop us a line and tell us what you
        think, guys!
