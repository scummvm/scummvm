1.0) About:
---- ------
ScummVM is a collection of interpreters, capable of emulating several
adventure game engines. ScummVM mainly supports games created using
SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), used in various
LucasArts games such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, and others.

ScummVM also contains interpreters for several non-SCUMM games. Currently
these are Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword 1 & 2, Flight of the Amazon Queen,
Gobliiins, Inherit the Earth, Simon the Sorcerer 1 & 2 and The Legend of
Kyrandia.

At this time ScummVM should be considered beta software, and is still
under heavy development. Be aware that whilst we attempt to make sure
that many games can be completed with few major bugs, crashes can happen.

If you enjoy ScummVM feel free to donate using the PayPal button on the
ScummVM homepage. This will help us buy utilities needed to develop ScummVM
easier and quicker. If you cannot donate, help and contribute a patch!

2.0) Contacting:
---- ----------
The easiest way to contact the ScummVM team is by submitting bug reports or
commenting in our forums. You can also join and e-mail the scummvm-devel
mailing list, or chat with us on IRC (#scummvm on irc.freenode.net)
Please do not ask us to support an unsupported game -- read the FAQ on our
web site first.

2.1) Reporting Bugs:
---- ---------------
To report a bug, please create a SourceForge account and follow the bugs
link from our homepage. Please make sure the bug is reproducible, and
still occurs in the latest daily build/current CVS version. Also check
the known bugs list (below) and compatibility listing for that game, to
ensure the issue is not already known.

Also do not report bugs on games that are not listed as being completable
in the 'Supported Games' section, or compatibility list. We -know- those
games have bugs.

Please include the following information:
        - ScummVM version (PLEASE test the latest CVS/Daily build)
        - Bug details, including instructions on reproducing
        - Language of game (English, German, ...)
        - Version of game (talkie, floppy, ...)
        - Platform and Compiler (Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, ...)
        - Attach a save game if possible
        - If this bug only occurred recently, please note the last
          version without the bug, and the first version including
          the bug. That way we can fix it quicker by looking at the
          changes made.

The following games are SCUMM engine, but NOT supported by ScummVM (yet).

     Other Humongous Entertainment titles

Please be aware that the engine may contain bugs and unimplemented features
that sometimes make it impossible to finish the game. Save often, and please
file a bug report (instructions on submitting bug reports are below) if you
encounter such a bug in a 'supported' game.

3.1) Copy Protection:
---- ----------------
The ScummVM team does not condone piracy. However, there are cases when
LucasArts themselves bundled cracked interpreters with their own games --
the data files still contain the copy protection scripts, but the interpreter
bypasses them. There is no way for us to tell the difference between legitimate
and pirated data files, so for the games where we know the original interpreter
may have been cracked ScummVM will always have to bypass the copy protection.

Wyrmkeep Entertainment kindly let us skip protection in floppy version of
Inherit the Earth since it was disabled in all CD releases of the game.

At the time of writing, that includes the following games:

Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade (EGA)
Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade (FM-TOWNS version)
Inherit the Earth (floppy version)
Loom (16 color floppy version)
Maniac Mansion
Monkey Island 1 (EGA)
Monkey Island 1 (VGA)
Monkey Island 2
Zak McKracken (EGA)
Zak McKracken (FM-TOWNS version)

Beneath a Steel Sky (bypassed with permission from Revolution)
Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb

In some cases ScummVM will still show the copy protection screen. Try entering
any answer. Chances are that it will work.

3.2) Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 notes:
---- ---------------------------------
If you have the dual version of Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2 on CD,
then you will find the Windows version in the main directory of the CD
and the DOS version in the DOS directory of the CD.

3.3) Broken Sword notes
---- ------------------
Broken Sword 1 and 2 both come with in-game cutscenes compressed using
RAD Game Tools legacy Smacker(tm) format. As RAD is unwilling to open
the older legacy versions of this format to us, and have requested we not
reverse engineer it, Revolution Software has kindly allowed us to provide
re-encoded Broken Sword cutscenes for download on our website.

These cutscenes are provided in MPEG2 format with OGG Vorbis audio.
Viewing these cutscenes thus requires a version of ScummVM compiled
with both libmpeg2 (preferably 0.4.0 or greater) and libVorbis support.

The cutscenes should be placed in the main game data directory. Note that
currently this requires either copying the game to harddisk or reburning
customised versions of the game CDs.

3.4) Flight of the Amazon Queen notes
---- --------------------------------
In order to use a non-freeware version of Flight of the Amazon Queen (i.e.
your own), you will need to have the 'queen.tbl' file (available from the
Compatibility page on our website) in either the directory containing the
'queen.1' datafile or in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides.

Alternatively, you can use the 'compress_queen' tool from the Tools module to
'rebuild' your FOTAQ datafile to include the table for that specific version,
and thus removing the run-time dependency on the 'queen.tbl' file.
This tool also allows you to compress the speech and sound effects with MP3,
OGG or FLAC.

3.5) Beneath a Steel Sky notes
---- -------------------------
As of ScummVM 0.8.0 you need the additional SKY.CPT file to run Beneath a
Steel Sky.

This file is available on the 'Compatibility' page of the ScummVM
website, you can place it in either the directory containing the other
datafiles (SKY.DNR, SKY.DSK) or in your extrapath.

3.6) Inherit the Earth notes
---- -----------------------
In order to run the Mac OS X Wyrmkeep re-release of the game you will need to
copy over data from the CD to your hard drive. If you're on a PC then consult:

  http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=maccd-howto

Although it primarily talks about SCUMM games, it mentions the "HFVExplorer"
utility which you need to extract the files.
Note that you have to put the speech data "Inherit the Earth Voices" in the
same directory as the game data which is stored in:

  Inherit the Earth.app/Contents/Resources

For old Mac OS9 release you will need to copy files in MacBinary format,
i.e. they should have both resource and data forks. Just copy all 'ITE *' files.

3.7) Gobliiins notes
---- ---------------
The CD version of Gobliiins contains one big audio track which you need to rip
(See the section on using compressed audiofiles) and copy into the game
directory if you want to have music and not have the CD in the drive
all the time.

3.8) The Legend of Kyrandia notes
---- ----------------------------
To run The Legend of Kyrandia under ScummVM you need the kyra.dat file,
which can be found in the Downloads section of the ScummVM website.

3.9) Maniac Mansion NES notes
---- ------------------------
Supported versions are English USA (E), French (F), German (G), Swedish (SW)
and European (U). ScummVM requires just PRG section to run and not whole ROM.

In order to get the game working, you will have to strip out the first
16 bytes from the ROM you are trying to work with. Any hex editor will work
as long as you are able to copy/paste.  After you open the ROM with the
hex editor, copy everything from second row (17th byte) to the end. After
you do this, paste it to a new hex file. Give the new file name
"Maniac Mansion (XX).prg" where XX depends on version you are  working
with (E, F, G, SW, or U).  The final size should be exactly 262144 bytes.

If you add game manually make sure that platform is set to NES.

Most common mistakes which prevent game from running:

  o Bad file
  o ROM extracted with the 0.7.0 tools
  o You try to feed ScummVM with the FULL rom and not just the PRG section.

Also it is possible to extract separate LFL files from PRG section. Use
extract_mm_nes utility from tools package.

3.10) Commodore64 games notes
---- -----------------------
Both Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken run but Maniac Mansion is not yet
playable. Either use extract_mm_c64 (but then game will not be autodetected)
or name D64 disks as "maniac1.d64", "maniac2.d64" and "zak1.d64", "zak2.d64"
respectively. If you add the game manually, make sure that platform is set to
Commodore64.

3.11) Known Problems
---- ---------------
This release has the following known problems. There is no need to report them,
although patches to fix them are welcome. If you discover a bug that is not
listed here, nor in the compatibility table on the web site, please see
the section on Reporting Bugs.

     CD Audio Games:
          - When playing games that use CD Audio (Towns variants, Loom CD, etc),
            users of Microsoft Windows 2000/XP may experience random crashes.
            This is due to a long-standing Windows bug, resulting in corrupt
            game files being read from the CD. Please copy the game data to
            your harddrive to avoid this.

     Monkey Island 1 (EGA):
     Loom (EGA):
          - MIDI support requires the Roland update from LucasArts

     Beneath a Steel Sky:
          - Amiga versions aren't supported
          - Floppy demos aren't supported
          - Not a bug: CD version is missing speech for some dialog, this is
            normal.

     Broken Sword 1:
          - Macintosh version isn't supported
          - PlayStation 1 version isn't supported

     Broken Sword 2:
          - PlayStation 1 version isn't supported

     Flight of the Amazon Queen
          - Amiga versions aren't supported

     Inherit the Earth
          - Amiga CD version isn't supported

     Simon the Sorcerer 1:
          - Amiga versions aren't supported
          - Subtitles aren't available in the English and German CD versions,
            they are missing the majority of subtitles.

     Simon the Sorcerer 2:
          - Combined speech and subtitles will often cause speech to be
            cut off early, this is a limitation of the original game.
          - Only default language (English) in data files is supported
            in Amiga and Macintosh versions.

     FM-TOWNS versions:
          - The Kanji versions require the FM-TOWNS Font ROM

4.0) Supported Platforms:
---- --------------------
ScummVM has been ported to run on many platforms and operating systems.
Links to these ports can be found either on the ScummVM web page or by a
Google search. Many thanks to the effort of porters. If you have a port of
ScummVM and wish to commit it into the main CVS, feel free to contact us!

Supported platforms include (but are not limited to):

        UNIX            (Linux, Solaris, IRIX, *BSD)
        Windows
        Windows Mobile  (iPAQ and other handheld devices)
        Mac OS X
        AmigaOS
        BeOS
        Dreamcast
        PalmOS
        Playstation 2
        Playstation Portable
        RISC OS
        Symbian

The Dreamcast port does not support Curse of Monkey Island, nor The Dig.
The PalmOS port does not support Curse of Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel
Sky, nor either Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2. The Dig will only work on some
Palm devices (those with a large dynamic heap).

In the Macintosh port, the right mouse button is emulated via Cmd-Click (that
is, you click the mouse button while holding the Command/Apple/Propeller key).

For the following platforms, custom backends were supported at one point
but currently are not being maintained (usually due to lack of a qualified
maintainer). In some cases (e.g. Linux), the standard SDL support works
instead.

        Linux           (includes iPAQs running Linux)
        MorphOS
        GP32

We have reports about unofficial ports to the following platforms. Please
note that this are not made by us, so we neither endorse nor support them.
Use at your own risk!

        Nintendo DS
        Xbox


5.0) Running ScummVM:
---- ----------------
Before you run the engine, you need to put the game's datafiles in a
directory. The filenames must not be in mixed case on *nix systems
(for example, these are valid names: "monkey2.000", "MONKEY2.000", while
this is a bad one: "Monkey2.000"). If you use a game with speech, the file
monster.sou must reside in the same directory as the datafiles.

Please note that by default, ScummVM will save games in the directory
it is executed from, so you should refrain from running it from more than
one location. Further information, including how to specify a specific save
directory to avoid this issue, are in section 6.0.

ScummVM can be launched directly by running the executable. In this case,
the in-built launcher will activate. From this, you can add games (click
'Add Game'), or launch games which have already been configured.

ScummVM can also be launched into a game directly using Command Line
arguments -- see the next section.

5.1) Command Line Options:
---- ---------------------

  --force-1x-overlay       Make inner GUI 320x200

  --alt-intro              Use alternative intro for CD versions of Beneath a
                           Steel Sky and Flight of the Amazon Queen
  --copy-protection        Enable copy protection in games, when
                           ScummVM disables it by default.
  --demo-mode              Start demo mode of Maniac Mansion (Classic version)
  --tempo=NUM              Set music tempo (in percent, 50-200) for SCUMM games
                           (default: 100)
  --talkspeed=NUM          Set talk speed for games


The meaning of most long options can be inverted by prefixing them with "no-",
e.g. --no-aspect-ratio. This is useful if you want to override a setting in the
configuration file.

The short game name ('game target') you see at the end of the command
line is very important. A short list is contained at the top of this
file. You can also get the current list of games and game names at:

5.3) Graphics filters:
---- -----------------
ScummVM offers several anti-aliasing filters to attempt to improve visual
quality. These are the same filters used in many other emulators, such as
MAME. These filters take the original game graphics, and scale it by a
certain fixed factor (usually 2x or 3x) before displaying them to you.
So for example, if the game originally run at a resolution of 320x200
(typical for most of the SCUMM games), then using a filter with scale
factor 2x will effectively yield 640x400 graphics. Likewise with a
3x filter you'll get 960x600.

They are:
        1x         - No filtering, no scaling. Fastest.
        2x         - No filtering, factor 2x (default for non 640x480 games).
        3x         - No filtering, factor 3x.
        2xsai      - 2xsai filter, factor 2x.
        super2xsai - Enhanced 2xsai filtering, factor 2x.
        supereagle - Less blurry than 2xsai, but slower. Factor 2x.
        advmame2x  - Doesn't rely on blurring like 2xSAI, fast. Factor 2x.
        advmame3x  - Doesn't rely on blurring like 2xSAI, fast. Factor 3x.
        hq2x       - Very nice high quality filter but slow. Factor 2x.
        hq3x       - Very nice high quality filter but slow. Factor 3x.
        tv2x       - Interlace filter, tries to emulate a TV. Factor 2x.
        dotmatrix  - Dot matrix effect. Factor 2x.

To select a graphics filter, pass its name via the '-g' option to scummvm,
for example:

    scummvm -g advmame2x monkey2

Note #1: Not all backends support all or any filters. The ones listed above
are for the default SDL backend.

Note #2: Filters can be very slow when ScummVM is compiled in a debug
configuration without optimizations. And there is always a speed impact when
using any form of anti-aliasing/linear filtering.

Note #3: The FM-TOWNS version of Zak uses an original resolution of 320x240 -
hence for this game scalers will scale to 640x480 or 960x720.

5.4) Hot Keys:
---- ---------
ScummVM supports various in game hotkeys. They differ between the SCUMM and
other games.

    Common:
        Cmd-q                  - Quit (Mac OS X)
        Ctrl-q                 - Quit (other unices including Linux)
        Ctrl-z OR Alt-x        - Quit (other platforms)

                                 modern monitors. Aspect-ratio correction
                                 stretches the image to use 320x240 pixels

Note that using ctrl-f and ctrl-g are not recommended: games can crash when
being run faster than their normal speed, as scripts will lose synchronisation.

Ctrl-f is not supported by the Broken Sword games.

5.5) Using data files from Macintosh game versions:
---- ----------------------------------------------
All LucasArts SCUMM based adventures except COMI also exist in versions for the
Macintosh. ScummVM can use most (all?) of them, however, in some cases some
additional work is required. First off, if you are not using a Macintosh for
this, accessing the CD/floppy data might be tricky, since the mac uses a
special disk format called HFS which other systems usually do not support.
However, there are various free tools on the net which allow reading such HFS
volumes (for example "HFVExplorer" for Windows and "hfsutils" for Linux and
other Unix-like operating systems).

Secondly, most of the newer games shipped only with a  single data file on the
Macintosh. You used to have to manually convert that data file, but this is no
longer necessary, as ScummVM can now open and understand the format natively.

5.6) Multi-CD Games:
---- ---------------
In general, ScummVM does not deal very well with multi-CD games. This is
because ScummVM assumes everything about a game can be found in one directory.
Even if ScummVM does make some provisions for asking the user to change CD, the
original games usually install a small number of files to hard disk. Unless
these files can be found on all the CDs, ScummVM will be in trouble.

Fortunately, ScummVM has no problems running the games entirely from hard disk,
if you create a directory with the correct combination of files. Usually, when
a file appears on more than one CD you can pick either of them.

These instructions are written for the PC versions (which in some case is the
only version) of the games. Windows and DOS use case-insensitive file systems,
so if one CD has a file called MONKEY.DAT and another has a file called
monkey.dat, they are the same files. These instructions give file names in all
lower-case names, even if that's not always how they appear on the CDs. In
fact, on case-sensitive file systems you will have to make sure that all
filenames use either all upper- or all lower-case letters for ScummVM to be
able to find the files.

The instructions for the Broken Sword games are for the Sold-Out Software
versions, which are the ones you are probably most likely to find in stores
now.

5.6.1) The Curse of Monkey Island:
------ ---------------------------
For this game, you'll need the comi.la0, comi.la1 and comi.la2 files. The
comi.la0 file can be found on either CD, but since they are identical it
doesn't matter which one of them you use.

In addition, you'll need a resource subdirectory with all of the files from the
resource subdirectories on both CDs. Some of the files appear on both CDs, but
again they're identical.

5.6.2) Broken Sword 1:
------ ---------------
For this game, you'll need all of the files from the clusters directories on
both CDs. You will also need the speech.clu files from the speech directories,
but since they are not identical you'll need to rename them speech1.clu and
speech2.clu for CD 1 and 2 respectively.

In addition, you will need a music subdirectory with all of the files from the
music subdirectories on both CDs. Some of these files appear on both CDs, but
in these cases they are either identical or, in one case, so nearly identical
that it makes little difference.

ScummVM does not support the original cutscene files, so there is no need to
copy them.

5.6.3) Broken Sword 2:
------ ---------------
For this game, you'll need all of the files from the clusters directories on
both CDs. (Actually, a few of them may not be strictly necessary, but the ones
that I'm uncertain about are all fairly small.) You will need to rename the
speech.clu and music.clu files speech1.clu, speech2.clu, music1.clu and
music2.clu so that ScummVM can tell which ones are from CD 1 and which ones are
from CD 2. Any other files that appear in both cluster directories are
identical. Use whichever you like.

In addition, you will need the cd.bin, cd.inf and startup.inf files from the
sword2 directory on CD 1.

ScummVM does not support the original cutscene files, so there is no need to
copy them.

6.0) Savegames:
---- ----------
Savegames are by default put in the current directory on some platforms and
preset directories on others.  You can specify the save in the config file by
setting the savepath parameter. See the example config file later in this
readme.

The platforms that currently have a different default directory are:
        Mac OS X:     $HOME/Documents/ScummVM Savegames/
        Other unices: $HOME/.scummvm/

You can also use the environment variable SCUMMVM_SAVEPATH to specify where to
put save games. Don't forget the trailing directory separator. Also be aware
that saved games may break between ScummVM releases.

Bash (Unix) example:
        export SCUMMVM_SAVEPATH=/tmp/scummvm_savegames/

Windows example:
        set SCUMMVM_SAVEPATH=C:\saved_games\

6.1) Autosaves:
---- ----------
Because ScummVM is still a beta product, it -can- crash and/or hang
occasionally. As such, every five minutes it will save a game in Slot 0. This
game can be loaded via Ctrl-0, or the F5 menu. This autosaving does not,
however, occur with Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, nor with Broken Sword 1 and 2.


7.0) Music and Sound:
---- ----------------
By default, on most operating systems, ScummVM will automatically use Adlib
emulation. MIDI may not be available on all operating systems or may need
manual configuration. If you ARE using MIDI, you have several different
choices of output, depending on your operating system and configuration.

        null       - Null output. Don't play any music.

        adlib      - Internal Adlib emulation (default)
        fluidsynth - FluidSynth MIDI emulation
        mt32       - Internal MT-32 emulation
        pcjr       - Internal PCjr emulation
        pcspk      - Internal PC Speaker emulation
        towns      - Internal FM-TOWNS YM2612 emulation

        alsa       - Output using ALSA sequencer device. See below.
        core       - CoreAudio sound, for Mac OS X users.
        coremidi   - CoreMIDI sound, for Mac OS X users. Use only if you have
                     a hardware MIDI synthesizer.
        qt         - Quicktime sound, for Macintosh users.
        seq        - Use /dev/sequencer for MIDI, *nix users. See below.
        windows    - Windows MIDI. Uses built-in sequencer, for Windows users

To select a sound driver, pass its name via the '-e' option to scummvm,
for example:

    scummvm -e adlib monkey2


7.1) Playing sound with Adlib emulation:
---- -----------------------------------
By default an Adlib card will be emulated and ScummVM will output the music
as sampled waves. This is the default mode for most games, and offers the
best compatibility between machines and games.


7.2) Playing sound with FluildSynth MIDI emulation:
---- ----------------------------------------------
If ScummVM was build with libfluildsynth support it will be able to play MIDI
music through the FluidSynth driver. You will have to specify a SoundFont to
use, however.

Since the default output volume from FluidSynth can be fairly low, ScummVM will
set the gain by default to get a stronger signal. This can be further adjusted
using the --midi-gain command-line option, or the "midi_gain" config file
setting.

The setting can take any value from 0 through 1000, with the default being 100.
(This corresponds to FluidSynth's gain settings of 0.0 through 10.0, which are
presumably measured in decibel.)

NOTE: The processor requirements for FluidSynth can be fairly high in some
cases. A fast CPU is recommended.


7.3) Playing sound with MT-32 emulation:
---- -----------------------------------
Some games which contain MIDI music data also have improved tracks designed
for the MT-32 sound module. ScummVM can now emulate this device, however you
must provide original MT-32 ROMs to make it work:

MT32_PCM.ROM     - IC21 (512KB)
MT32_CONTROL.ROM - IC26 (32KB) and IC27 (32KB), interleaved byte-wise

Place these ROMs in the game directory or a directory specified by extrapath.

You don't need to specify --native-mt32 with this driver, as it automatically
gets turned on.

NOTE: The processor requirements for the emulator are quite high; a fast CPU is
strongly recommended.


7.4) Playing sound with MIDI emulation:
---- ----------------------------------
Some games (such as Sam and Max) only contain MIDI music data.  This once
prevented music for these games from working on platforms that do not support
MIDI, or soundcards that do not provide MIDI drivers (e.g, many soundcards will
not play MIDI under Linux). ScummVM can now emulate MIDI mode using sampled
waves and Adlib, FluidSynth MIDI emulation or MT-32 emulation using the
-eadlib, -efluidsynth or -emt32 options respectively.  However, if you are
capable of using native MIDI, we recommend using one of the MIDI modes below
for best sound.


7.5) Playing sound with Native MIDI:
---- -------------------------------
Use the appropriate -e<mode> command line option from the list above to
select your preferred MIDI device. For example, if you wish to use the
Windows MIDI driver, use the -ewindows option.


7.5.1) Using MIDI options to customize Native MIDI output:
------ ---------------------------------------------------
ScummVM supports a variety of MIDI modes, depending on the capabilities
of your MIDI device.

If --native-mt32 is specified, ScummVM will treat your device as a real
MT-32. Because the instrument mappings and system exclusive commands of
the MT-32 vary from those of General MIDI devices, you should only
enable this option if you are using an actual Roland MT-32, LAPC-I, CM-64,
CM-32L, CM-500, or GS device with an MT-32 map.

If --enable-gs is specified, ScummVM will initialize your GS-compatible
device with settings that mimic the MT-32's reverb, (lack of) chorus,
pitch bend sensitivity, etc. If it is specified in conjunction with
--native-mt32, ScummVM will select the MT-32-compatible map and drumset on
your GS device. This setting works better than default GM or GS emulation
with games that do not have custom instrument mappings (Loom and Monkey1).
You should only specify both settings if you are using a GS device that
has an MT-32 map, such as an SC-55, SC-88, SC-88 Pro, SC-8820, SC-8850, etc.
Please note that --enable-gs is automatically disabled in both DOTT and
Samnmax, since they use General MIDI natively.

If neither of the above settings is enabled, ScummVM will initialize your
device in General MIDI mode and use GM emulation in games with MT-32
soundtracks.

Some games contain sound effects that are exclusive to the Adlib soundtrack.
For these games, you may wish to specify --multi-midi in order to combine
MIDI music with Adlib sound effects.


7.6.0) Playing sound with Sequencer MIDI:                        [UNIX ONLY]
------ ----------------------------------
If your soundcard driver supports a sequencer, you may set the environment
variable "SCUMMVM_MIDI" to your sequencer device -- for example, to
/dev/sequencer

If you have problems with not hearing audio in this configuration, it is
possible you will need to set the "SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT" variable to 1 or 2. This
selects the port on the selected sequencer to use. Then start scummvm with the
-eseq parameter. This should work on several cards, and may offer better
performance and quality than Adlib emulation. However, for those systems where
sequencer support does not work, you can always fall back on Adlib emulation.


7.6.1) Playing sound with ALSA sequencer:                        [UNIX ONLY]
------ ----------------------------------
If you have installed the ALSA driver with the sequencer support, then
set the environment variable SCUMMVM_PORT or the config file parameter
alsa_port to your sequencer port. The default is "65:0".

Here is a little howto on how to use the ALSA sequencer with your soundcard.
In all cases, to have a list of all the sequencer ports you have, try the
command "aconnect -o -l". This should give output similar to:
client 64: 'External MIDI 0' [type=kernel]
    0 'MIDI 0-0        '
client 65: 'Emu10k1 WaveTable' [type=kernel]
    0 'Emu10k1 Port 0  '
    1 'Emu10k1 Port 1  '
    2 'Emu10k1 Port 2  '
    3 'Emu10k1 Port 3  '
client 128: 'Client-128' [type=user]
    0 'TiMidity port 0 '
    1 'TiMidity port 1 '

This means the external MIDI output of the sound card is located on the
port 64:0, four WaveTable MIDI outputs in 65:0, 65:1, 65:2
and 65:3, and two TiMidity ports, located at 128:0 and 128:1.

If you have a FM-chip on your card, like the SB16, then you have to load
the soundfonts using the sbiload software. Example:
  sbiload -p 65:0 /etc/std.o3 /etc/drums.o3

If you have a WaveTable capable sound card, you have to load a sbk or sf2
soundfont using the sfxload software. Example:
  sfxload /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2

If you don't have a MIDI capable soundcard, there are two options: FluidSynth
and TiMidity. We recommend FluidSynth, as on many systems TiMidity will 'lag'
behind music. This is very noticeable in iMUSE-enabled games, which use fast
and dynamic music transitions. Running TiMidity as root will allow it to
setup real time priority, which may reduce music lag.

Asking TiMidity to become an ALSA sequencer:
  timidity -iAqqq -B2,8 -Os1S -s 44100 &
(If you get distorted output with this setting, you can try dropping the
-B2,8 or changing the value.)

Asking FluidSynth to become an ALSA sequencer (using SoundFonts):
  fluidsynth -m alsa_seq /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2

Once either TiMidity or FluidSynth are running, use the 'aconnect -o -l'
command as described earlier in this section.


7.7.0) Using MP3 files for CD audio:
------ -----------------------------
Use LAME or some other MP3 encoder to rip the cd audio tracks to files. Name
the files track1.mp3 track2.mp3 etc. ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support
to use this option. You'll need to rip the file from the CD as a WAV file,
then encode the MP3 files in constant bit rate. This can be done with the
following LAME command line:

  lame -t -q 0 -b 96 track1.wav track1.mp3


7.7.1) Using Ogg Vorbis files for CD audio:
------ ------------------------------------
Use oggenc or some other vorbis encoder to encode the audio tracks to files.
Name the files track1.ogg track2.ogg etc. ScummVM must be compiled with vorbis
support to use this option. You'll need to rip the files from the CD as a WAV
file, then encode the vorbis files. This can be done with the following oggenc
command line with the value after q specifying the desired quality from 0 to 10:

  oggenc -q 5 track1.wav


7.7.2) Using Flac files for CD audio:
------ ------------------------------------
Use flac or some other flac encoder to encode the audio tracks to files.
Name the files track1.flac track2.flac etc. In your filesystem only allows
three letter extensions, name the files track1.fla track2.fla etc.
ScummVM must be compiled with flac support to use this option. You'll need to
rip the files from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the flac files. This can
be done with the following flac command line:

  flac --best track1.wav

Remember that the quality is always the same, varying encoder options will only
affect the encoding time and resulting filesize.


7.7.3) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with MP3:
------ ---------------------------------
You need LAME, and our compress_scumm_sou utility from the scummvm-tools
package to perform this task, and ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support.

  compress_scumm_sou monster.sou

Eventually you will have a much smaller monster.so3 file, copy this file
to your game directory. You can safely remove the monster.sou file.


7.7.4) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Ogg Vorbis:
------ ----------------------------------------
As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with OGG support. Run:

  compress_scumm_sou --vorbis monster.sou

This should produce a smaller monster.sog file, which you should copy to your
game directory. Ogg encoding may take a considerable longer amount of time
than MP3, so have a good book handy.


7.7.5) Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Flac:
------ ----------------------------------------
As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with Flac support. Run:

  compress_scumm_sou --flac --best -b 1152 monster.sou

This should produce a smaller monster.sof file, which you should copy to your
game directory. Remember that the quality is always the same, varying encoder
options will only affect the encoding time and resulting  filesize. Playing
with the blocksize (-b <value>), has the biggest impact on the resulting
filesize -- 1152 seems to be a good value for those kind of soundfiles. Be sure
to read the encoder documentation before you use other values.


7.7.6) Compressing sfx/speech in Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2
------ ----------------------------------------------------
Use our compress_simon util from the scummvm-tools package to perform this
task. You can choose between multiple target formats, but note that you can
only use each if ScummVM was compiled with the respective decoder support
enabled.

  compress_simon effects     (For Acorn CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_simon simon       (For Acorn CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_simon effects.voc (For DOS CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_simon simon.voc   (For DOS CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_simon simon.wav   (For Windows CD version of Simon 1)
  compress_simon simon2.voc  (For DOS CD version of Simon 2)
  compress_simon simon2.wav  (For Windows CD version of Simon 2)
  compress_simon mac         (For Macintosh version of Simon 2)

For Ogg Vorbis add --vorbis to the options, i.e.

  compress_simon --vorbis

For Flac add --flac and optional parameters, i.e.

  compress_simon --flac --best -b 1152

Eventually you will have a much smaller *.mp3, *.ogg or *.fla file, copy this
file to your game directory. You can safely remove the old file.

7.7.7) Compressing speech/music in Broken Sword 1
------ ------------------------------------------
The compress_sword1 tool from the scummvm-tools package can encode music and
speech to MP3 as well as Ogg Vorbis.
The easiest way to encode the files is simply copying the executable into your
BS1 directory (together with the lame encoder) and run it from there.
This way, it'll automatically encode everything to MP3.
Afterwards, you can manually remove the SPEECH?.CLU files and the wave music
files.

Running "compress_sword1 --vorbis" will compress the files using Ogg Vorbis
instead of MP3.

Use "compress_sword1 --help" to get a full list of the options.


7.7.8) Compressing speech/music in Broken Sword 2
------ ------------------------------------------
Use our compress_sword2 util from the scummvm-tools package to perform this
task. You can choose between multiple target formats, but note  that you can
only use each if ScummVM was compiled with the respective decoder support
enabled.

  compress_sword2 speech1.clu
  compress_sword2 music1.clu

For Ogg Vorbis add --vorbis to the options, i.e.

  compress_sword2 --vorbis

Eventually you will have a much smaller *.cl3 or *.clg file, copy this file to
your game directory. You can safely remove the old file.

It is possible to use Flac compression by adding the --flac option. However,
the resulting *.clf file will actually be larger than the original.

Please note that compress_sword2 will only work with the four speech/music
files in Broken Sword 2. It will not work with any of the other *.clu files,
nor will it work with the speech files from Broken Sword 1.


7.8) Output sample rate:
---- -------------------
The output sample rate tells ScummVM how many sound samples to play per channel
per second. There is much that could be said on this subject, but most of it
would be irrelevant here. The short version is that for most games 22050 Hz is
fine, but in some cases 44100 Hz is preferable. On extremely low-end systems
you may want to use 11025 Hz, but it's unlikely that you have to worry about
that.

To elaborate, most of the sounds ScummVM has to play were sampled at either
22050 Hz or 11025 Hz. Using a higher sample rate will not magically improve the
quality of these sounds. Hence, 22050 Hz is fine.

Some games use CD audio. If you use compressed files for this, they are
probably sampled at 44100 Hz, so for these games that may be a better choice of
sample rate.

When using the Adlib, FM Towns, PC Speaker or IBM PCjr music drivers, ScummVM
is responsible for generating the samples. Usually 22050 Hz will be plenty for
these, but there is at least one piece of Adlib music in Beneath a Steel Sky
that will sound a lot better at 44100 Hz.

Using frequencies in between is not recommended. For one thing, your sound card
may not support it. In theory, ScummVM should fall back on a sensible frequency
in that case, but don't count on it. More importantly, ScummVM has to resample
all sounds to its output frequency. This is much easier to do well if the
output frequency is a multiple of the original frequency.


8.0) Configuration file:
---- -------------------
By default, the configuration file is saved in, and loaded from:

        Windows:  <windir>\scummvm.ini,
        Unix:     ~/.scummvmrc
        Mac OS X: ~/Library/Preferences/ScummVM Preferences
        Others:   scummvm.ini in the current directory

9.0) Compiling:
---- ----------
You need SDL-1.2.2 or newer (older versions may work, but are unsupported), and
a supported compiler. Several compilers, including GCC, mingw and Microsoft
Visual C++ are supported. If you wish to use MP3-compressed CD tracks or
.SOU files, you will need to install the MAD library and define
USE_MAD. Tools for compressing .SOU files to .SO3 files can be
found in the 'tools' CVS module, or in the 'scummvm-tools' package.

Some parts of ScummVM, particularly scalers, have highly optimized versions
written in assembler. If you wish to use this option, you will need to install
nasm assembler (see http://nasm.sf.net). Note, that currently we have only x86
MMX optimized versions, and they will not compile on other processors.

On Win9x/NT/XP you can define USE_WINDBG and attach WinDbg to browse debug
messages (see http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml).

    GCC:
        * Type ./configure
        * Type make (or gmake, or gnumake, depending on what GNU make is
          called on your system) and hopefully ScummVM will compile for you.

    Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0:
        * Open the workspace, scummwm.dsw
        * Enter the path to the needed libraries and includes in
          Tools|Options|Directories
        * Now it should compile successfully.

    Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0:
        * Open the solution file scummwm.sln
        * Enter the path to the needed libraries and includes in
          Tools|Options|Projects|VC++ Directories
        * Now it should compile successfully.

    Windows Mobile with Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ 3 or 4 :
        * Download SDL with additional Windows Mobile tweaks:
          http://arisme.free.fr/ports/SDL.php
        * Download additional third party libraries:
          http://arisme.free.fr/ports
        * Modify your include and library paths accordingly in EVC3/EVC4.
        * Open the ScummVM project dists\msevc4\PocketSCUMM.vcw
        * Modify the libraries and config parameters if necessary.
        * Now it should compile successfully.

    Debian GNU/Linux:
        * Install the packages 'build-essential', 'fakeroot', 'debhelper',
          and 'libsdl1.2-dev' on your system.
        * Install any of these packages (optional): 'libvorbis-dev' (for Ogg
          Vorbis support), 'libasound2-dev' (for ALSA sequencer support),
          'libmad0-dev' (for MAD MP3 support), 'zlib1g-dev' (for compressed
          saves support).
        * Run 'make deb'.
        * Finally run 'dpkg -i ../scummvm-cvs*deb', and you're done.

    Mac OS X:
        * Make sure you have the developer tools installed.
        * The SDL developer package for OS X available on the SDL web site is
          _not_ suitable. Rather, you require a unix-style build of SDL. One
          way to get that is to install SDL via Fink (http://fink.sf.net).
          Alternatively you could compile SDL manually from source using its
          unix build system (configure && make).
        * Type ./configure in the ScummVM directory
        * You can now type 'make' to create a command line binary.
        * To get a version you can run from Finder, type 'make bundle' which
          will create ScummVM.app (this only works if you installed SDL
          etc. via Fink and into /sw. If you have installed SDL
          in another way, you'll have to edit the Makefile).

    AmigaOS 4 (Cross-compiling with Cygwin):
        * Make sure that you have SDL installed, you may also need
          libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile, zlib, libmad.
        * Type ./configure --host=ppc-amigaos
        * If you got an error about sdl-config, use --with-sdl-prefix
          parameter to set the path.
        * Check 'config.mak' file and if everything seems to fine:
        * Run 'make'.
        * Cross-compiling with Linux may be as easy.
