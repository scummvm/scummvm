Residual: A 3D game interpreter

Last updated:    $Date$
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Residual?
-----------------
Residual allow to play 3D games such as Grim Fandango.

Residual utilizes OpenGL for 3d graphics hardware acceleration.
A software renderer is also included for machines without hardware OpenGL.

Which games does it support?
----------------------------
Residual is a fairly slow developing project and is still very much considered
alpha. Currently it contains initial support for Grim Fandango.

It is possible, but far from promised, that the other LucasArts LUA-based
title 'Escape from Monkey Island' may be supported in the distant future.

How do I run Residual?
----------------------
As Residual is still under heavy development it is not yet stable, easy
to use, or complete. Some technical ability is required.

See the Configuration File section to see how to create the configuration
file.

To see a list of supported command-line parameters, run Residual with the
argument --help

Configuration file:
-------------------
By default, the configuration file is saved in, and loaded from:

        Windows Vista:
        \Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Residual\residual.ini

        Windows 2000/XP:
        \Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Residual\residual.ini

        Windows NT4:
        <windir>\Profiles\username\Application Data\Residual\residual.ini

        Windows 95/98/ME:
       <windir>\residual.ini

        Unix:
        ~/.residualrc

        Mac OS X:
        ~/Library/Preferences/Residual Preferences

        Others:
        residual.ini in the current directory

It runs really slow !
----------------------------------------
A large portion of gfx cards do not have a fast glDrawPixels access to zbuffer 
implementation in the driver.

Unix users may be able to achieve playable framerates by using Mesa 5.0 or
above, but people unable to upgrade or Windows users must use software
renderer. Software renderer is generally faster on modern platform.

-------------------------------------------------------
Turn off "force fullscene antialiasing" in the OpenGL gfx driver options.

What is the state of Residual? 
------------------------------
Basic gameplay works, including cutscenes. Parts of the game are playable,
but many features are either missing or unstable. There is no ability
to reliably save/load games, etc. Crashes are likely.

Game currently playable to:
	Meche leaves Manny again (Rubacava, Year 2)

Caveats (in order of appearance):
1) Sound track destruction doesn't do quite a good enough job when
   entering the spider web area (sp.set) in the Petrified Forest
2) Video of Copal's death (among other movies) plays at *almost* 2x
   the correct speed, this causes buffer overflows in the audio.
   While hardcoding the speed to the correct value used by the other
   movies works, it is not a good fix and so it is not implemented
3) Sometimes the Demon Beavers get stuck on obstacles - open the 
   menu for a moment and they will correct themselves
