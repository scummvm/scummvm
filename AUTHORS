Special thanks to
*****************
   The LUA developers, for creating a nice compact script interpreter. 

   Tim Schafer, for obvious reasons, and everybody else who helped make Grim
   Fandango a brilliant game; and the EMI team for giving it their best try.

   Bret Mogilefsky, for managing to create a SPUTM-style 3D LUA engine, and
   avoiding the horrible hack it could have been.

   Benjamin Haisch, for emimeshviewer, which our EMI code borrows heavily
   from.
