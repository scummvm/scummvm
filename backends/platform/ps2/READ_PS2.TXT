ScummVM-PS2 0.12.0 Readme
========================

You need a PlayStation 2 with a modchip of your choice in order to run ScummVM.

ScummVM expects the game data on CD-R/DVD-R, on the Harddisk or on a USB mass
 storage device.

 It tries to mount the HDD partition hdd0:+ScummVM on startup and basically
 treats it in the same way as the DVD drive.
 Creating the partition and putting the datafiles there is up to you.

 Not all USB mass storage devices are supported, but the most common ones should
  work. If you attach a device and it gets recognized, it will show up together
  with the CD/DVD drive and HDD in the "Add Game" dialog.

 Most USB Mice and Keyboards should work, too. I have a Logitech MX500 mouse that
  doesn't work, all the other devices I tried worked fine.


Creating a CD-R using CD-Tool
=============================

Copy any games you want on the CD over into the directory where you extracted
 the ZIP file. Don't copy any files directly into the directory of the
 ScummVM.ELF, those files are ignored. Instead, have each game in its own
 directory.

 File- and directorynames should be DOS 8+3, if they aren't, they'll get
  renamed.

 If you run windows, just double click the make_iso.bat.
  Wait while it creates the ISO image and burn it with Nero
  or any other CD writing software.

 For Linux or Mac OS X binaries check http://www.nobis-crew.org/cd-tool/

 Unfortunately, writing DVD images with cd-tool is currently broken.
  This problem will probably be fixed in the nearer future.


If you want to create a CD/DVD without CD-Tool, make sure to put the ELF,
 the SYSTEM.CNF and all the IRXs into the CD/DVD's root directory.


Notes
=====
- The Curse of Monkey Island only works correctly from HDD.
   Playing it from CD/DVD will initially seem to work, but you will
   experience random crashes.
- Compressed SAN files need a lot of CPU power, probably because of zlib,
   and are constantly out of sync. Uncompressed SANs play fine though, so
   compress_san is NOT recommended.
- The cd/dvd drive is a bottleneck, that's why you should compress the games
   with MP3 using compress_scumm_sou / compress_scumm_bun / compress_sword1 /
   compress_sword2 etc, but NOT compress_san.
- I haven't had time to implement a virtual keyboard. If you don't have a USB
   keyboard, you can only enter '1's using the Select button.
   (for copy protection screens as well as savegame names)
- When you see '1's and '0's flying across your screen, it means ScummVM is
   accessing the Memory Card. Don't switch off or reset the console in that
   case, and don't remove the Memory Card either :P
