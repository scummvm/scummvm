About the backend/port

This is the readme for the official GP2XWiz ScummVM backend (also known as
the GP2XWiz port).

This is an SVN test release of ScummVM for the GP2XWiz, it would be
appreciated if this SVN test distribution was not mirrored and that
people be directed to http://scummvm.distant-earth.com/ instead for
updated SVN builds.

Full supported official releases of the GP2X WIZ ScummVM backend are made in
line with main official releases and are avalalble from the ScummVM
downloads page <http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php>.

This build is in an active state of development and as such no
"expected" behavior can be guaranteed ;).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game compatibility

For information on the compatability of a specific game please refer to
the GP2XWiz compatability section of the ScummVM WiKi
<http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/GP2XWiz#Compatibility_List>.

Please note the version and date of the ScummVM build you are running
when reviewing the above list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported audio options

Raw audio.
MP3 audio.
OGG Vorbis audio.

FLAC audio is currently unsupported.

For best results use uncompressed audio in games.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to save

NOTE: Everything is saved to the SD card, saves are stored in the saves
folder under your main ScummVM executable unless you set another save
location.

The configiration file for ScummVM (.scummvmrc) is stored in the same
place as the ScummVM executable.

The save process below is for Scumm engine games but the principle is
the same for all.

In Game.

1. Menu Button
2. Select SAVE with B
3. Select a position with B
4. Right trigger puts 0 in the name box for some text.
5. Press B to save

Basically the emulated keys you can use are equivelent to the values
buttons are mapped to,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Controller mappings

Touch screen:
Touch: Move Pointer and Left click

Mouse emulation:

dPad: Move Pointer
B: Left click
X: Right click

Keyboard emulation:

Right Trigger: Return
Select: Escape
Y: Space Bar (Pause)
Menu: Game Menu (Save, Load, Quit etc.)
Volume Buttons: Increase and Decrease volume

Fancy button combos:

NOTE: To use button combos press and hold the Left Trigger then...

Right Trigger: Display Virtual Keyboard 
Menu: Bring up the Global main menu for ScummVM
Select: Exit ScummVM completely (and gracefully)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
