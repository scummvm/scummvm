About the backend/port

This is the readme for the offficial GP2X ScummVM backend (also known as
the GP2X port).

This is an SVN test release of ScummVM for the GP2X, it would be
appreciated if this SVN test distribution was not mirrored and that
people be directed to http://www.distant-earth.com/scummvm instead for
updated SVN builds.

Full supported official releases of the GP2X ScummVM backend are made in
line with main official releases and are avalalble from the ScummVM
downloads page <http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php>.

This build is in an active state of development and as such no
?expected? behavior can be guaranteed ;).

SVN builds are quickly tested with firmware 2.0.0 for reference.

Please refer to the GP2X ScummVM forum
<http://forums.scummvm.org/viewforum.php?f=14> and WiKi
<http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/GP2X> for the latest information on
the port.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game compatibility

For information on the compatability of a specific game please refer to
the GP2X compatability section of the ScummVM WiKi
<http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/GP2X#Compatibility_List>.

Please note the version and date of the ScummVM build you are running
when reviewing the above list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included engines

Just because an engine is included does not mean any/all of its games
are supported. Please check game compatability for more infomation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported audio options

Raw audio.
MP3 audio.
OGG Vorbis audio.

FLAC audio is currently unsupported.

For best results use uncompressed audio in games.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported cut-scene options

No cut scene compression options are currently supported.

DXA video support will be added as soon as it is stable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recent changes

Refined audio hacks to reduce audio delay a little more.
Enabled hardware scalar code.
Now built using SDL 1.2.9 for the parts of the port that use SDL (some
parts now hit the hardware directly).
Enabled new launcher - (Ensure defaulttheme.zip is in the same folder as
the executable).
Aspect Ratio Correction can now be disabled ?per game?. When adding a
game you can find this option on the GFX tab.
Note: This will cause the game to run with a black border at the bottom
as it will be rendered to a 320*200 frame.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to save

NOTE: Everything is saved to the SD card, saves are stored in the saves
folder under your main ScummVM executable unless you set another save
location.

The configiration file for ScummVM (.scummvmrc) is stored in the same
place as the ScummVM executable.

The save process below is for Scumm engine games but the principle is
the same for all.

In Game.

1. Right Trigger
2. Select SAVE with B
3. Select a position with B
4. Right trigger puts ? in the name box for some text.
5. Press B to save

Basically the emulated keys you can use are equivelent to the values
buttons are mapped to,

I have a virtual keyboard like the GP32 one (left/right on the stick to
pick chars) to add in at some point ;-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Controller mappings

Mouse emulation:

Stick: Move Pointer
Stick Click: ?light? Left Click
B: Left click
X: Right click

Keyboard emulation:

Start: Return
Select: Escape
Y: Space Bar (Pause)
Right Trigger: Game Menu (Save, Load, Quit etc.)
Volume Buttons: Increase and Decrease volume (5% per press)

Fancy button combos:

NOTE: To use button combos press and hold the Left Trigger then...

Y: Toggle "zoom" mode - Try it in larger games like Broken Sword.
Volume Buttons: Increase and Decrease subtitle speed (In SCUMM games)
Right Trigger: 0 (For skipping the copy protection in Monkey Island 2)
Select: Exit ScummVM completely (and gracefully)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Know issues

Possible random crash (well SegFault). I have had this happen twice and
have not tracked down the cause.
It happens very infrequently, both times it was in the DOTT CD intro.
Saving often is never a bad idea anyhow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO's

Fix save support when using the Sky engine (Beneath a Steel Sky) - You
CAN'T save at the moment but auto save works.
