ScummVM-Switch README
==============================================================================

Installation
============
 - The latest daily version of ScummVM for Switch is [here](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/snapshots/master/switch-master-latest.zip) (needs to be unzipped).
 - Copy the scummvm folder to your SD card into the folder /switch/ so that you have a folder `/switch/scummvm` with `scummvm.nro` and other folders inside.
 - Launch ScummVM using your favorite method to launch homebrew on the Switch

Notes

Building the source code
========================
This port of ScummVM to the Switch is based on SDL2. It uses the open source SDK provided by devkitPro.

To build ScummVM for Switch:

 - Obtain the ScummVM source code (https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm)

 - Install the development tools for Switch following the official instructions (https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

 - Install libraries via
```
sudo dkp-pacman -S \
switch-sdl2 \
switch-libmad \
switch-libogg \
switch-libvorbis \
switch-flac \
switch-libtheora \
switch-libpng \
switch-libjpeg-turbo \
switch-zlib \
switch-freetype \
switch-sdl2_net \
switch-curl \
switch-libtimidity \
switch-pkg-config
```

 - Create a subdirectory somewhere outside the source folder for your ScummVM build and cd into it

 - Execute the command (once a curl-config script exists for devkitA64, the --disable-libcurl could be omitted)
```
../scummvm/configure --host=switch --disable-libcurl
```

 - Execute the command
```
make scummvm_switch.zip
```
