General questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I install ScummVM for Windows CE ?
-----------------------------------------

If the current release includes a .EXE installer, ScummVM for Windows CE
will be installed without hassle.
Otherwise, you'll unzip the release on your desktop computer, and copy 
the EXE file on your device.

If you're using a Pocket PC 2000 operating system, be sure to have GAPI
installed - it's available on Microsoft website http://www.microsoft.com

How do I install a game ?
-------------------------

You'll at least need to copy all the data files from your game, in a 
sub-directory of your game directory. 

You'll need to put the data files in a directory named after ScummVM game
name (see "Supported Game" section in ScummVM readme) for the games having
"generic" data files (.LFL files). Recent games can be put in any directory.

You can compress the sound files (.SOU) using the "extract" tool described in 
the ScummVM readme.

You can compress the audio tracks of Loom or Monkey Island 1 as described in
the ScummVM readme. If you are running these games on a slow device with Ogg
Vorbis compression, it's recommended to sample the files to 11 kHz (this sample
rate is not supported by other versions of ScummVM).

If you need more details, you can check SirDaved mini-manual online available 
at http://www.pocketmatrix.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8606

How do I run a game ?
---------------------

If it's the first time you're running ScummVM for Windows CE, have installed or
removed games, you need to rescan your game directory. 
 * On Pocket PCs and Handheld PCs, tap the "Scan" button, select your upper 
   game directory, and tap the "Scan" button again.
 * On Microsoft Smartphone devices, choose the "Scan" option in the "Game" 
   menu.
A list of recognized games will be displayed. If your game is not detected 
check its directory name and your installation.

To play a game
 * On Pocket PCs and Handheld PCs, tap on its name then tap the "Play" 
   button
 * On Microsoft Smartphone devices, choose it from the "Play" sub-menu in the
   "Game" menu

How do I play a game on a Pocket PC or Handheld PC device ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The stylus is your mouse cursor, and a tap is a left mouse button click.

As the Pocket PC lacks some keys, a toolbar is displayed at the bottom of the
screen to make the most common functions just a tap away
  * The disk icon opens ScummVM options menu to save your game, or change your
    current game settings.
  * The movie icon skips a non interactive sequence, the current dialog or 
    behaves like the ESC key on a regular keyboard
  * The sound icon turns all sound effects and music off and on
  * The monkey icon switches between portrait and landscape mode

You can map additional actions on your device hardware buttons using the 
"Options" / "Key" menu in the ScummVM options menu. To associate an action to
a key, tap the action, then the "Map" button and press the hardware key.
The following actions are available 
  * Pause       : pause the game
  * Save        : open ScummVM option menu
  * Quit        : quit ScummVM (without saving, be careful when using it)
  * Skip        : skip a non interactive sequence, the current dialog or 
    behaves like the ESC key on a regular keyboard
  * Hide        : hide or display the toolbar
    - YOU MUST HIDE THE TOOLBAR TO SCROLL THROUGH THE INVENTORY IN ZAK -
  * Keyboard    : hide or display the virtual keyboard
    - YOU MUST DISPLAY THE KEYBOARD TO FIGHT IN INDIANA JONES 3 -
  * Sound       : turns all sound effects and music off and on
  * Right click : acts as a right mouse button click
    - YOU MUST MAP THIS ACTION TO PLAY THE FOLLOWING GAMES -
    - SAM & MAX, BENEATH A STEEL SKY, CURSE OF MONKEY ISLAND -
  * Cursor      : hide or display the mouse cursor
  * Subtitles   : hide or display the subtitles
  * Boss        : turn off all sound, blanks the screen, save the game and
    run the tasks application :)
  * Free look   : go in or out of free-look mode. In this mode, you can tap 
    the screen to look for interesting locations without walking.

If you start a game when a Right click mapping is necessary, ScummVM will ask
you to map one of your hardware key to this action before playing. Just press
the key you want to map if you see this message.

How do I play a game on a Microsoft Smartphone device ?
-------------------------------------------------------

You move the cursor with the "Left", "Right", "Up" and "Down" keys, and click
with the "Left Click" or "Right Click" keys.
The cursor will move faster if you keep the key down. 

The "Zone" key is a *very* valuable addition allowing you to jump quickly 
between three screen zones : the game zone, the verbs zone and the inventory 
zone. When you switch to a zone the cursor will be reset to its former location
in this zone. 

The "Options" key opens ScummVM action menu.

The "Boss" key turns off all sound, blanks the screen, save the game and run 
the tasks application :)

You can change the keys mapping in the main screen in the "Options" menu. Select
an action in the "Keys Mapping" submenu, then press the key you want to map to 
this action.

Game xxx is too slow on my device
---------------------------------

Even if it shouldn't happen (this port is running almost correctly on a 
80 / 120 MHz SPV phone), you can try some things :

  * Disable sound in the engine (add the line "NoMusic = true" to the wince 
    section of your scummvm.ini file)
  * Play with the priority of the sound thread (change the SoundThreadPriority
    value - the higher the lower priority)
